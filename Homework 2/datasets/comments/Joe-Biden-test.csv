11287,Lmao fuck off concern troll
11288,smh guess you’re part of the establishment 😤
11289,Oh man it's almost as though being sexually assaulted by a powerful politician is terrifying and can lead a person to do things that appear irrational.
11290,"Kerry also isn’t a good comparison, I think.


The country was still getting over the emotional trauma of September 11th and Bush still had a lot of built-up goodwill for how he handled himself in it.  Iraq was starting to get dicey in 2004 and public support was beginning to turn against the war (which would continue throughout the election year).


Kerry was a fairly strong candidate.  However, he suffered by getting swiftboated and he wasn’t able to overcome Bush’s residual popularity by the end of the race."
11291,"I say it’s because they’re everywhere, no one wants them in their house, and they have an overestimated worth."

11293,You might not want to make that bet. The rule of thumb IS after the convention but presidents have endorsed before the convention in cases where there would be a clear and obvious winner.
11294,Honestly that’s the majority of what campaign e-mails and texts are regardless of the candidate. Lol
11295,Let's go folks! I have my ice cream and aviators ready!
11296,2016's republican primary played out like 2020's democratic primary and Bernie's taking the place of Kasich not dropping out until Biden secures the nomination.
11297,"""Clean sweep"" is right, I wouldn't be surprised if he keeps winning every state going forward."
11298,It basically is already. I think Bernie would need to get like 70 %of the remaining delegates at this point.

11302,"I think he'll drop out by next week. I love the guy, and would prefer him myself but I just don't see a path forward.

At least Joe's pretty reliable and ten thousand leagues above the current guy in office."
11303,I am yang gang for Joe. Go check out joebiden.com for details. He is very pragmatic!
11304,"&gt; Glad she seems to want to be part of the big tent

Hopefully the squad is able to drag Bernie Sanders away from toxicity!"
11305,Have you ever seen Joe not get angry and and borderline abusive when confronted in public by a citizen that disagrees with some aspect of Joe's policy or record? Because I don't think I have. His customary response is to tell someone to go vote for Trump. Is there a section of the ROTR for that?
11306,"I do remember learning the difference at age four (and watching the Clinton/Bush Sr debates, lol) and telling everyone I knew that I was a Democrat.  Really, telling everyone who would listen..."
11307,Most know that. Anger and disappointed is currently over-riding logic.
11308,"Tammy Baldwin, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Val Demings, Catherine Cortez Masto, etc."
11309,$100 of that came from me!
11310,As a vt Republican its impressive joe got 20% of the vote in vt. Bernie is down from 85% in 2016 to 50%
11311,"Just try to remember that they can hoot and holler all they want, but Diamond Joe won and won big. Know what you’re up against and also try to cleanse your timeline and your reddit feed. Take a break from being online, even being in here can rile us up sometimes. As a former Buttigieg supporter...yeah I heard a LOT of horrible horrible stuff and just had to block and report, then go make a gin and tonic and read a book."
11312,Basic probability is mental gymnastics?
11313,"I’m on the fence here, why do you guys want Biden so badly?"
11314,"Lol, is she serious? He's accomplished infinitely more than Joe. Biased much?"
11315,"You can put all of Klobuchar's in Biden's side, and around 75% of Pete's"
11316,Ya but it only matters of biden does it i guess
11317,Welcome fellow YangGanger!
11318,No I don’t feel that way as a whole. I have just received a decent amount of hate from certain candidates supporters. I feel like this sub is more aligned with my views.

11325,Honestly I wouldn’t expect it. Trump is cheap and lazy and already made Trump-Pence signs for this election cycle.
11326,"This is a big tent of unity, healing, and forgiveness.  What you do moving forward matters.  We can forgive the past (and eventually the present).

The only question I have is how you can be associated with a campaign that attacks people for having a disability like a stutter, being female, or gay.  I wouldn't care if I were in perfect alignment with every policy of a candidate.  The moment any bigotry arose, I'd be gone."
11327,"And hopefully people on your side see that Biden is not the same politician he was in the 1970s.  Like the rest of the Democratic Party, he can move with the times.  He came out against the Hyde Amendment because it’s no longer acceptable for Democrats to support while Republicans are dismantling abortion laws throughout the country.  He can change.


Bernie deserves a seat at the table when drafting the platform.  However, he shouldn’t feel like he gets to dictate all the planks if the majority of voters have voted against him."
11328,"According to the polls taken, a large share of people in many of these states have voted absentee or early. That will mitigate the effect that the virus may have.

It could also hurt Bernie's people because a lot of college students are in the middle of traveling back home right now."
11329,I'd rather not have my country torn apart by a war between two populist demagogue. Getting high with the White House's permission is a lot lower of a priority for me.

11331,"Hi, it’s Lis.

11332,I’ve seen a few people with it and that’s exactly what it looks like
11333,What's the third language at the top? A French creole?
11334,Biden has no problem with the black vote.  And he’ll take her home state of CA easily.  Her base is his base.  She’d make a better AG than a running mate.
11335,"hey joe, you have my vote, now do me a solid, ADOPT MEDICARE FOR ALL!!"
11336,"Democrats also aren't really doing anything to establish credibility on this issue. You can say that corporate influence and superpacs are a necessary evil, but it's hard for me to envision the blueprint away from it without a style of politics that looks something a great deal like Bernie's."
11337,"I can't blame her, especially after seeing the crap her husband had to put up with."
11338,"If it was all the same person I'd totally understand,  but realize this sub has 4.4k members and S4P has 400k+.  What you have is a subset that think attacking other candidates on the internet is an intelligent way to spread a message. 

Then,  when a candidate drops out you have the sensible supporters outreaching and getting blindsided.   Bernie's base tends to be younger.  You have to realize too that these recent election cycles have been polarized to the point people think about it on the same level as sports fandom.

I've been inaccurately called sexist,  homophobic and a myriad of other insults by many other campaigns. I find it offensive but I also know that doesn't represent what policies those other candidates stand for."

11340,"I don't think so, but I'll play around and find out."
11341,"Harris has both supported M4A and the Public Option which is probably one reason why her campaign floundered. I don't think she'd have any problem pivoting to a stance like 

""I think eventually we might get to M4A. But that's not going to happen anytime soon and right now we need immediate solutions to help people. That solution is the Biden Public Option Obamacare 2.0 plan. We know how to pay for it, we know how to implement it in under a year after passage, and we know how to get the votes in the Senate. It's the quickest and best path to covering tens of millions of people who are uninsured or underinsured today without breaking today's healthcare system as we are still recovering from corona virus."""
11342,"What’s the quote, exactly?

What do you mean “for one”? You should really provide all the examples you’re talking about."
11343,"CNN replaying it now. It was free, no log in required on cnn.com."
11344,yeah it's cool to maintain a system where 68000 americans die every year from lack of healthcare so you feel more comfortable with it
11345,"But.... Biden voted repeatedly to freeze or cut Social Security.
  
&gt;Biden, Jan. 31, 1995: When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.   
  
Then in Nov 1995 Biden offered to cut Medicare spending to make a deal with Republicans. [Full transcript here](https://www.congress.gov/104/crec/1995/11/16/CREC-1995-11-16-pt1-PgS17196-2.pdf)  
  
Then in 2007 in an interview Biden said that we need to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security / Medicare and halt cost of living adjustments. [Interview here](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18381961/ns/meet_the_press/t/mtp-transcript-april/#.XihkbSN7mUm)  
  
And then again in 2012, while vice-president, Biden pushed to raise the retirement age and cut Social Security spending to reduce the deficit. [Article here](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html?pagewanted=all)  
 
With that kind of track record, I'm not sure how anyone could take Biden seriously in 2020 when he assures us that he won't cut Social Security or Medicare. I'm certainly willing to listen to any evidence to the contrary."
11346,"Trying to really understand the underlying political philosophy behind this point of view. Where does the public domain end and the private domain begins?

Take molding them into good citizens as an example. If society at large (through their democratically elected representatives) decided that part of being a good citizen is spending at least 3 years playing little league baseball to get first hand familiarity with the national pastime, should they be able to manifest that will through a government little league *mandate*?

Or, do we say that even if it's good for kids, and even if it's good for society, that decision it outside the public realm and is a decision for private families?"
11347,The ideal VP pick is someone from a swing state more progressive than Joe and a woman of color tbh
11348,They're populists. They'll vote for whoever makes the most noise.
11349,I saw some hypothesizing that Pete had been considering running for governor if the presidential campaign didn't pan out - apparently the day he actually signed up to be on Indiana's ballot for the primaries was the day before the deadline to sign up to run for governor. They suggested he would have run for governor if he had felt the need to drop out sooner
11350,Jilly B
11351,Or /r/The_Bernie
11352,"I agree March 17th, given the demographics of the states up for grabs, looks like it’s going to be a good day for Biden"
11353,"Because badly beaten Sanders won’t step down, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. 

Thank, Bernie."
11354,"I don’t think single payer should necessarily be out of the question. I think it would be a huge cultural break as opposed to universal multiplayer with public options, and so shouldn’t be preferred. I don’t view it as evil or anything. The problem with Bernies plan is the complete elimination And Illegalization. of any secondary market. That is unprecedented and unacceptable to me. 

That’s fine also. It’s alright. I think we’re pretty far apart ideologically and I don’t think you should necessarily change. Diversity of thought is good."
11355,LOL i was waiting to see this connection
11356,"I still don't understand the idea that Bernie can't win. Biden polls better against Trump then Bernie does but not by much, and Biden's debating skills have fallen off more then a little since 2008 and 2012, and he's very gaffe-prone, something that Trump is very good at exploiting. Not to mention Sanders does better against Trump in the Rust belt overall as well as my own home state of Texas, two areas that could single handedly decide the election."
11357,"He will give rambling eight hour speeches and college kids will harrass Mitch McConnell until Republicans simply cave.

Just like how Bernie got Senate Republicans to remove Trump from office."
11358,Let’s hope we pull the W down in Florida!
11359,TN is ours!!! Mwahahahah!!! The powa!!!
11360,Plot twist: he pulls a Putin and just gives Obama the job
11361,it's been brought to my attention that Joe and Pete are literally PB&amp;J and now I'm just furious with myself to my core that I didn't think of it first
11362,Biden/Pocket Turtle it is then!
11363,"True, but it does point out the stupidity of attributing the economy wholly to a President. If Trump is why the economy is good, why doesn't Obama get credit for the rise in the economy during his admin? Because of double standards."
11364,"Yeah, every thing (before Super Tuesday) I said was really calm"
11365,"I had the misfortune of overhearing The Blaze. The way they spin it is that Biden is a marxist, but he surrounds himself with the Clintons, who are corrupt oligarchs, who are culturally marxist to destabilize our country, but economically want to keep capitalism because they enrich themselves from it. Bernie has made himself an enemy of the clintons, and wants pure communism. Take that how you want."

Another really amazing point during this campaign was when Biden volunteers did the High Hopes dance in honor of Team Pete. This is the love and unity that we've been missing so badly for the past 4 years."
11368,"I feel like most people haven’t considered the gigantic wave of disillusionment if Bernie were to get into office.

Bernie’s base complains when Democrats don’t support them on every single issue. Imagine if he gets in office and can’t get anything done. So many people will quit politics because they were straight-up conned."
11369,Honestly I could see a Pete/Amy ticket some years down the line.
11370,Where’s Bernie?
11371,"Honest question, would you really consider someone a 'socialist moniker' when he's just proposing what the rest of the world has already been doing for decades?"
11372,I need that pete for joe flair!
11373,"I believe Bernie would actually take the country towards socialism. And I ain't talking about Medicare!

I'm talking about the Federal Jobs Guarantee, and giving 20% ownership and 45% control of all major corporations over to the employees.

A Sanders win would give a ton of momentum to the socialist movement, and as someone who believes in capitalism, I really don't want to see that. Assuming this is the last time Sanders runs, the socialists will be without a major figure to rally behind, and I think the whole thing will recede. I think Bernie's socialist supporters also believe that, and it's why they've become so toxic."
11374,"I can appreciate wanting to fix healthcare, and the environment. They're certainly very high on my list. But I done see Bernie being able to pass anything if he was president. It wouldn't help those issues at all. We've been debating health care since the 80s. What makes his supporters think Bernie will be able to push through the most far left plan this century? He would need a democratic supermajority in Congress, and that's not happening. And since he isn't willing to compromise, that'll be the end of it."
11375,The people producing these videos should be condemned by both campaigns. If you don't care about lying to win you are no better than donald trump.
11376,"If that's his selling point it's a bad one. OH is probably lost and the rest of those are areas Biden does very well in. 

On the other hand, Biden not only brings a traditional rust belt strategy, but he can open up an entirely new front in the Sunbelt and makes Texas competitive."
11377,Nah that one gaffe of Biden did more push to advance the cause of marriage equality. I would dare say it single-handedly pushed the Obama administration to be more public in their support for marriage equality.
11378,Millenials are also people born in 1980
11379,The humor is lost on me.
11380,"Single-payer in the Sanders sense (banning private insurance) is actually incredibly rare. Really only the Nordic countries, Canada, and Britain have gone as far as he's suggesting (and even then, some of them still allow private insurance). Pretty much all of continental Europe has multi-payer universal, either with a public option, or with all private non-profits in a few cases like the Netherlands. I think just making Medicare available for anyone to opt into, and then enrolling uninsured people automatically is the smartest way to expand affordable coverage. I also think we should license private insurance at the federal rather than state level, so that companies can't have local monopolies on private insurance."
11381,"&gt;He’s probably seething about the coronavirus ruining the economy, and with it the best argument for his reelection.

No doubt that a recession would mean President Biden?"
11382,It’s an objectively poor strategy
11383,Mathematically this race is effectively over.
11384,"Yeah like I don't even mean that as a criticism, it's just very obvious she's a professor first and a senator a distant second."
11385,"You're being a real idiot on this topic, really highlighting your ignorance of European countries

Why would any country in EU ban private healthcare? 99.9% of people use public, it's literally only celebrities and politicians, or bankers who use private. You're comparing apples and oranges, like i've been saying, Bernie is radical left on issues such as free internet, but things like healthcare, yeah maybe he's radical to want to ban private healthcare, but that's an american only policy, that doesn't need to happen in the UK because we sorted it out over 70 years ago!!!!! The EU doesn't need to revisit healthcare because it's been sorted for 3 generations. So in that context, whatever Bernie or Biden do on the subject can't be compared to the EU, other than to say ""universal healthcare brings America in line with Europe"" so in that context, yes banning private is radical in Europe, but then in Europe we don't have to shift 300 million people from private healthcare onto a public system. My grandfather remembers being switched from a healthcare ""club"" to the NHS.

Considering the UK and most other European countries have political parties called ""The Communist Party"", then yes Bernie is pretty central because he is a Democratic Socialist, and his most radical idea to Americans is pretty reasonable to Europeans, even conservative Europeans would do that. It's only things like free internet that are more radical, because the EU hasn't gone that far - yet. Stop trying to shift the goal posts and make false comparisons to extremify Bernie, he's not that special."
11386,So many people think if you work for a corporation you’re complicit. I worked for a huge retailer and get treated like shit by some of friends for it.
11387,They both walked back those comments. How was it rigged exactly?
11388,Joe ain't perfect. But Joe is compassionate :)
11389,Anybody concerned that older (or younger) voters might not stay home due to the importance of this election and what it means to them and they get sick and it overwhelms the system?
11390,He will certainly find some extremely bad faith excuse to continue this charade—just like he did in 2016.
11391,Haha I love this
11392,"Something ""better"" in name only. His M4A plan would fail HARD in practice."
11393,why do I find this hard tk believe
11394,"We welcome you with open arms man. Listen, in the long run Joe’s policies will get us closer to what Bernie’s preaching faster than Bernie even could. He already called himself a bridge to the next generation. But right now, we need him. We need his expertise and ability to heal after this era. We need for once a leader we can all look up to and say we respect and are proud of. We need a bit of normalcy again, the soul of the nation is crying out for it—evidenced by Biden’s victories.

So let’s heal this country, together. All supporters are welcome. We are the Democratic Party, and we have to stop Donald Trump."
11395,"He never will be, the Democrats conceded the presidency to the republicans the second dems started backing joe. You guys have fun pretending he can win. I’ll be back in January to congratulate all of your efforts to keep trump in office, most of you are as delusional as the drooling man you support"
11396,God I love Beto so much
11397,Endorsing doesn't mean that she's going to be VP.
11398,"Not just UBI, but also M4AWWI"
11399,I think Trump has the virus and the white house is going to cover it up as long as they can.
11400,"Missed last 20 minutes, miss anything big?"
11401,Most legislation is passed with little airing in public.  It is here that bipartisanship exists.
11402,"Joe Biden needs to be doing something. Everyday. He needs to be on our TVs, in our radio, on FB, something. Like even if he just read a story from a kids book like Mister Rogers. Something. People need to see/hear him."
11403,"&gt;Protect and expand Obamacare

This would be great but I don't believe it. Biden might throw a bone here and there to improve Obamacare, but after 4 or 8 years there's no way it would be fundamentally different.

&gt; some negative like job losses)

Should we keep health insurance jobs around just because?  Do we prop up the buggy whip industry these days? 

&gt;  causing people to lose hope in the political system 

No it won't, because a honest, good faith attempt at something shows.  It also shows who would be against it, and that might out folks like yourself.  Which is why I think you're against it.

&gt;. because some asshole wanted to promise everyone a puppy

I'm just some asshole, but[ it seems like over half the country](https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/) wants universal coverage.  So keep the status quo like you want may not be so simple."
11404,"Excellent, good job on Joe and his outreach.  It's especially needed right now, we have to unify the democratic party and fast if we want to beat Trump.  


Now I voted for Sanders, and was banned for /r/sandersforpresident for asking them to tone down there attacks, and now I am all in for Joe.  I want him to win and I want to help show people that his policies and Sanders aren't too far off (not just status quo).  There are going to be a lot of people who want to drag their feet in the mud or name call or complain.  Don't be one of those people.  Be open, be willing to show a better way.  Be ready to unify the democratic party.  


WE are here to unite, we have to bring leadership back to Washington and help ensure supreme court seats aren't lost.  Biden is going to help us get there, and I hope other former-Sanders supporters can hop aboard soon."
11405,"Preach! And he's gotten even more progress since the publication of this ad; namely his housing plan, warren bankruptcy plan, and bernie-inspire free college for families earning less than $125,000."
11406,Oh no! I'm looking forward to buying a South Carolina for Biden shirt soon (when I get paid) to support the campaign. I'm a ladies XS so hopefully they'll have teeny tiny sizes in stock on Friday.
11407,"Bernie Sanders supporter here, while I've seen a lot of petty nonsense and hate from Bernie's supporters I've seen a lot of love and encouragement. 

  Browsing here, I can say the same is true for Biden's. I wouldn't/won't bash someone because they support a different candidate but I'll say here what I've said on Bernie's sub: 

 Trump is the one winning right now because we're at each other's throats and he is exploiting the shit out of it."

11411,"&gt;Obviously you lot aren't left wing, but if centrists lose another election, my god.

Y'all seem to have trouble understanding that you don't even have the votes to win the Democratic Party, much less the general election. Centrists (which is an interesting way to spell everyone who's not a socialist) get the nomination because that's what most Democrats want."
11412,"How in the world can reasonable person hope that America votes in Donald Trump again? This election affects countries outside of the US too, you know. Insane."

11414,Why are you being so rude to people saying the headline is confusing? Headlines are not written as proper sentences and it takes a second to get your head around them sometimes. It's not a big deal.
11415,I guess abortion is the one exception. You are right that is this is a hot topic in a few countries in Europe.
11416,"Come on man.. Corey Booker has called him out for it.. Morning Joe.. 

Everyone likes to act like this is only coming from Republicans and progressives.. it is coming from moderates too.. I will say it again.. this is too important not to have all the info.. I seriously doubt Joe would even mind taking the test if he knows it will reassure voters that are considering joining his camp."
11417,"#lol

he said that as a barb against republicans; that he would consider someone across the aisle if they weren't so batshit gone.

but keep gaslighting."
11418,"Look at my previous response on this. Everyone needs to understand more about where everyone else is coming from which requires rational discussion between supporters of different candidates. Think what you want of Bernie and his supporters, you need a lot of them to vote for Joe in the general if he gets the nomination. Downvoting anyone who disagrees is not the way to drive unity. This is absolutely also true of Bernie's supporters."
11419,"we must move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"
11420,"Welcome! I'm also here from Bernie's camp, and it's much better than I expected.

Biden doesn’t want to get rid of traditional Medicare or private plans. He doesn’t want the federal government to seize control of healthcare from the states.

Instead he wants universal healthcare for all Americans with the option of getting that healthcare from the federal government. People who want to keep their current plan would be allowed to."

Pal, you are literally advocating for Marxism. You're not a democratic socialist, you're a communist. Just to let you know, Bernie's not a communist and does not support Karl Marx's theory.

He caucused with Democrats for decades, he campaigned for Democrats for decades, he worked with them on bills and agendas for decades. I dont understand why you think any of this matters. People care about policy, about your voting record as an official, about what you've done to make the world a better place.

Also, the big private insurance companies have as much collective bargaining power as some European state healthcare providers, since they insure so many people, so I don't see that as being the cause of cost differences.

I mean maybe it would have some cost advantages, but I don't think it's a magic bullet solution to our healthcare cost problem."

Daily briefs, collecting information, making and building networks, talking to larger donors and handling the overall backdrop is more important.

People are stress and afraid right now, because Trump screwed the pooch and we need to focus on that message.

Trump fucked up. 

BUT, we're having issues with Sanders people still attacking from the back. It's hard to move forward when someone is stabbing you in the back all the time.

So a lot of things are in the mix right now. 

We're trying to give out as much information as we can. 

I would NOT recommend donating to a relief fund if you have extra money. Keep said money if possible and focus on getting members of congress to address the issues.

If you're 100% sure that you might have some extra, then put it into the red cross directly. Don't make up a lose fund with a lot of movement, use only solid funding relief places.

11557,"I don't personally think he'll pass Medical for All anytime soon, but I also think that once he doesn't he'll still push for a public option. It's not enough but it's better than nothing, and at least he'll try to go all the way whether it's easy or not. Biden being in the middle of the party does not guarantee him a unifying candidate, I've talked to many Sanders supporters who say the won't vote for him and many more who say they won't vote for him if he loses the pledged delegate count.

I think it's a bit of a dis to compare Bernie to Trump, sure many of his supporters take things too far, but he condemns them and he does not use racist or sexist rhetoric to get his way. Also I don't think there's any candidate who can bring unity to the white house, whatever that means. Unite the party? Maybe. Unite the capital as a whole? Not that I see.

I strongly disagree that we would shift further left under Biden than Bernie, who is objectively further left. I already stated that just because Medicare for All is Bernie's preferred position doesn't mean he wouldn't fight for a public option if it failed to pass. I don't even consider Biden to be on the left, because in most of the NATO countries he would be center or even center right. I like to point out how it was Otto von Bismark, a staunch conservative and monarchist, who implemented the first Universal Healthcare system in Germany in the 1800s.

Republicans who hate Bernie are people who are voting eother way. Bernie's consistency and honesty has drawn many Republicans. My dad is a lifelong conservative who voted for Trump, but he says he would vote for Bernie because he can be confident he will fight for the ordinary people. The average person is sick and tired of corruption in Washington D.C., and few people are as aggressive against it as Bernie (though Warren comes to mind)

I hope this provides some insight on my thinking as a Sanders supporter"

I identify most with Democratic policies but not all and I think elected officials should vote for what they think is right and is best for the people. Not what’s best for the party. Telling me Joe will do what he’s told doesn’t help me vote for him. In fact that’s exactly why I was torn between Sanders and Warren. They’re both passionate fighters. Who truly believe what they’re selling. 

At the same time I understand the need for the ability compromise and get thing’s done. But the other side of the isle isn’t budging no matter what. We need strong, passionate fighters.

11587,"&gt; Bernie draws in tons Independent and some Conservative support which will be needed in the general election. 

You all keep saying this but it’s never been proven. 

As an independent in my 20s (in a different country I’d probably be registered with the Green Party?) I vote Dem because they align most closely with my political interests. Most other independents I know who are actually politically involved and actually vote are similar — picking the party they align most with and voting in those primaries. If Bernie has all this independent support, where are they? If you don’t actually take advantage of your right to vote, your opinion doesn’t matter. 

I see hundreds of thousands of twitter bots and people my age on social media talking a big game about how they love and believe in Bernie (and hurling hella sexist, racist, and homophobic abuse around on his behalf which is quite charming) but they seem to be MIA at the polls, where those of us who believe in real change like to go. People physically fought for my right to do that so I’m gonna do it tyvm. It’s the actions of me and people like me that determine what’s electable, not opinion poll results.

Anyway, my point being, Bernie is not more electable than Biden because regardless of people’s feelings, when it comes to actual concrete action, _actual voters are not voting for him._ Just like in 2016."

11595,"it is not being divisive when the political calculation tells you that it is either Bernie or Biden at this point. 

Voting for Pete/Amy/Bloomberg means that you are dividing moderate votes which means that you are contributing to Bernie's victory which will guarantee trump reelection.

Think outside the box. I would have dumped Biden without a second thought if I think Pete is more viable candidate.

Don't let your fanaticism and purity test blinds you from political reality."

11607,"If the polls in the rest of the states showed Bernie winning, yes. It would be over for Biden. Stop with the whole tin foil hat conspiracies.

What you don’t understand is to make up the difference in delegates, Bernie needs to not only win more states, but win big in at least a few. No polls show him winning any states, let alone in a large margin. There’s multiple states coming up where Sanders might not even pick up a single delegate, such as Florida which has 248 delegates. Bernie can’t make up for these kinds of losses. The same would be true for Biden if everything were in the complete reverse."
11608,"just like burning your house down would create jobs. When you rebuild it you will have a more efficient home but you have to go through the pain part of building and paying for the rebuild.  these companies have market caps in the trillions. they are mostly owned by pension funds like the  teachers unions and nurses so you can't just destroy them. If you burn your house down you still have to pay off the mortgage. The cities that have the companies have built infrastructure for the workers. Roads, schools, water works etc.  this was paid for with muni bonds, those need to be paid off.  Its a massive massive project  , it would be the biggest legislation since the 13th amendment. 

Does Bernie Sanders, the guy running around calling everyone corrupt, strike you as the next Lincoln who could pull this off?"

Black voters + suburban white women (2018 coalition) is the way to go.

Harris, Klob, Duckworth, Warren, Baldwin would all be excellent picks until Dems suddenly lose against Trump because they ignore the guy polling +17% against Trump in favor of someone like [Warren who only got 1/3 of white women vote in her own state.](https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock/status/1235346488462630913)"

Know that i was speaking of extremely hostile elements, there is no telling how many of them there is, there's a chance it's like 7 or 10% of total Bernie's supporters but they are just so loud and active. 

Also, i do not personally call on senator Sanders to drop out. I've been following him ever since i started treating politics seriously and he didnt disappoint me once, my respect for him is just as big as for Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton (one more reason it annoys me so much when his supporters attack the latter two). My issue is with those who claim they speak on his behalf and slur, harass other candidates. It is Bernie's right to run for however long he wants to, i just hope his campaign does not target Joe with any more attack ads because that really is providing talking points and arguments for Trump."
11646,And joe’s no fool
11647,"Beto and Warren are my two perfect VP candidates imo.

Beto is popular amongst young and Latinos, literally the two missing pieces from the Obama coalition we're missing. Having him on the ticket, esp since Joe is a bit up there in age would be extremely electric to the young crowd. It might also put places in Southwest like Arizona and Nevada in play.

Warren another solid pick as well, she's a women and I've always seen her as a progressive who actually knows how to get her plans done. She's more willing to compromise and could definitely be a bridge to the progressives if this primary is going to get more ugly (at this point I think it will).

I have no idea what the hype is about Abrams tbh, I never heard her name before 2018 and Joe does solid with this demographic anyway. Kamala doesn't bring anything to ballot yet just confirming to everyone the whole ""establishmet"" narrative as well as she just seems to be best suited for AG. Pete is too young, I definitely think he needs some sort of cabinet position before being 1 heartbeat away from the presidency. 

Who knows though other than Joe at this point, it just speculation. I just hope he doesnt make the same mistake as Hillary and pick a boring pick like Tim Kaine. Nothing against Kaine but he didn't add anything to ticket other than being from VA and a white guy who can speak Spanish. We need some excitement esp because of skeptics about Joe's age."

If we ""Look back fondly"" it's only because European politicians are embarassed to be seen with Trump. Of course we prefer Biden to Trump, but what do we have to look forward to with Biden? More of the same? The EU is looking ahead to future problems and future solutions. America is still trying to work out things for itself like healthcare. Yes I am sort of implying that the EU would take a side, as we did against Trump. Trump didn't visit the UK for years because he was afraid of the mass protests that were organised in response. I think in the end he was allowed 1 day in Buckingham palace and then off to golf in Scotland, where he was protested lol. Trump makes Obama's administration seem great, but it wasn't.

What makes stuff like that particularly relevant is that I think a lot of the younger generation is kinda hoping to return to something similar to that sort of noblesse oblige.

-200B investment into renewables AND  nuclear power

-Decriminalized weed

-A full public option that doesn’t take away your plan if you want it, everyone gets the government plan if they can’t afford anything else

-100B investment into high speed rail because Amtrak is cool

-A carbon tax

-Universal pre-k, community college and trade school

-publicly funded elections (one of my favorites) 

And all of this without increasing the deficit!

-a record of being an effective legislator, passing stuff like the violence against women act, the Brady Bill and spearheading the withdrawal from Iraq and implementation of Obamacare

-a guy who may not be up to date on the latest PC terms but is driven by the mindset the all people are deserving of dignity and respect.

-a guy who has been through the wringer and grew up working class, a man who’s defining characteristic is empathy.

Pete was my first choice and I’m a bit left of Biden but Joe is a moral man, and I think that counts for a lot.

From approval it looks to take 5 years.

Nuclear is expensive, but in order to decarbonise as quickly as possible we must use everything at our disposal to save the planet.

The reason why most UK plants don't get built is because the government doesn't fund them which means that they are private and because most UK energy is cheap, wind and gas, nuclear doesn't sell well.  That's why any nuclear programme needs government money but it is essential to have some nuclear to decarbonise as quickly as possible."

11790,"&gt;There’s a strong possibility that moving forward, COVID-19 will deter a LARGE proportion of people inclined to vote for Biden, but Bernie supporters are young, fanatic, and undeterred, and will still turnout for Bernie and can tip the scales in his favor. 

With respect, this is wrong. Older voters consider voting to be a civic duty, along the same lines as serving in a jury or the draft. Young people insist on the stars aligning, and are eager for any excuse to be deterred from voting. They're only fanatic online.

By my math, Bernie needs 58.8% of the remaining delegates to win. He isn't leading by that much in *any* upcoming states. Biden's victory doesn't hinge on intangibles like 'momentum', or the money-efficiency of his campaign. Assuming that the polls are anywhere close to the truth, his victory is assured.

The pandemic does not improve Bernie's chances. He's aligned with alternative medicine, and only hostile to the pharmaceutical companies we depend on for help. The more serious the situation becomes, the more important it will become, in the minds of voters, to have proven, serious solutions.

&gt;Bottom line: Bernie isn’t still in this race to be a pain in the ass. Bernie is in it to win, and given the extraordinary circumstances, he still can.

He's in it to make money and sabotage a country that has a political and economic system that he hates. Socialists have been the bad guys since 1871. Prefixing his ideology as 'democratic' socialism only serves to tip his hand as to following the same path as Venezuela."

A minority of the party has decided the Democratic Party doesn’t represent them any more and they’re trying to convince the majority they’re wrong - when the reality is, they’re not democrats 

The Socialists just aren’t democrats. We are capitalists. They won’t accept that fundamental difference. 

Bernie spews hate at the democratic establishment, he criticizes everything the democrats have done for two decades - and he runs edited ads with Obama as if Barack has endorsed him.

He’s a socialist trying to mask himself in legitimacy using the Democratic Party as his shield. These aren’t democrats"

11807,"Also, working class Americans in swing states. Hillary couldn't and didn't apparently try or give enough fucks about Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota. Joe Biden has always been known as working man's Joe, comes from those communities, has worked for 40 years to make those communities better, and can connect with them in a way that makes them feel confident. 

Also, at this is very, very key, Hillary's 2016 election was about her. ""I'm with Her"". Check out Shattered: Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign. Whatever else Joe does, whatever his weaknesses or incapabilities he has to, has to, has to, without missing a beat on it, and that's what everyone from Clayburn and Pete are telling him thankfully, has to : 

Firstly, make the campaign about voters and their issues, not about him 

Secondly, do not get afraid of the media or allow his minor gaffes to be played up as major scandals. As Chris Hayes recently said, the media has a real balance problem with Trump. Trump does so many really scandalous and illegal and immoral things so quickly, because news media is built on balanced reporting, they have to play up every minor flaw of his opponent to even match what Trump is doing. It was all about emails in 2016. So don't get scared of the media, don't get secretive, be completely open and transparent and have a good relationship with the media on this. There are going to be boogeymen and skeletons in the closet for Joe that Donald, a reality tv star, will exploit. That's why he was contacting the Russians and Ukrainians to begin with. Joe not only has to weather that storm calmly and without respite, but also point out how that's illegal and harming our country."

(And ""fell apart... for a reason?"" All her campaigned (as well as Warren's) proved was that kinda being an easy compromise candidate who's in enough with progressives but acceptable to establishment types isn't enough to walk the tight rope if the voters still have the ability to opt for the more pure progressive &amp; more pure moderate.)"
11815,"This is also why most people arent excited for Biden or why you guys usually are met with negativity online. People are dying and struggling and your whole platform is, ""one day itll be better"" its sad. We cant shoot for the stars, we need another decade before we can modernize to the rest of the world."

11838,It's exactly the question Bernie would have been expecting and was asked the right way in exactly the context he should expect it.

Bernie was a terrible embarrassment last night. I want my $27 back from 2016. His campaign is a mathematical lost cause, Biden is the de facto nominee, and all that selfish idiot can do is repeat his favorite lines from his stump speech 45 times each and launch misleading attacks on Biden over old votes pulled out of context. 

Whatever hope I was holding out that Bernie might have a selfless bone in his body vanished last night. His campaign is all about his ego at this point. Bernie's campaign is effectively a Trump SuperPAC, and by staying in the race he's selfishly boosting turnout at a time when we need to minimize it to protect against the coronavirus."

&gt; And at a press conference at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, Trump said he didn’t want to bring the Grand Princess’s passengers back to land because doing so would increase the official count of US coronavirus cases.

&gt; “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault,” Trump said. “I’d rather have them stay on, personally.”

The President is more concerned with the appearance and how he might be blamed than he is about the crisis itself."

11847,"&gt; I don't want the most extreme. I want medicare for all

There is not a single country in the world that has Bernie's proposed m4a, and Bernie's bill wasn't even good enough for committee level discussion.  OTOH Bidens public option will provide universal healthcare, and was one vote short of becoming law in 2010. 

&gt; a government that cares about the environment, 

Obama/Biden administration launched usas most ambitious environment plan - signing Paris Accord, implementing major fuel efficiency goals, huge investment in solar and wind energy, and subsides for green vehicles. 

&gt; and to end citizens united/Super pacs. 

This can only happen at Supreme court level. For that you need SC majority and hope they turnover their original decision. 

Otherwise you will need a constitution amendment, and that is almost impossible, as if required 67 senators and 38 states approval."
11848,"Its because delegates are awarded porportionally in each state.

So to bridge that gap not only would Sanders need to start winning more states with higher delegates then Biden, but he would need to win them by significant margins. This counting the small portion of superdelegates in each state that normally choose Biden.

The two largest states with the largest delegates are already done, California and Texas. 

That's plus Biden just needs to get to 1991 delegates to win. 

So no it's not immpossible. But like it's very unlikely."
11849,You’re arguing against voting? Seriously?
11850,There are many different Biden supporters just like there are many different Bernie supporters.
11851,To be fair I think Bernie will pull out before another state votes. Biden is the presumptive nominee and she said she’d back the nominee
11852,Massive endorsement!

Trump doesn’t seem to get that people need money to create demand to for goods and services which makes companies hire workers and leads a thriving middle class, and that is what will make the stock market strong."

And then deliver his stump speech, cause that worked so well last week."
11871,"Leadership starts from the top. There is a reason Bernie's campaign is inciting this kind of behavior. It's not just on reddit. Look at the people he has employed to manage his campaign and messaging. Look at media outlets like The Intercept and Chapo Trap House and listen to the words they use to discuss the democratic party, its members and other campaigns.  He is leading a populist movement, and populist movement's have this effect on people.  The vitriol runs deeper than Reddit. It's being legitimized and not condemned.

Edit: I respect you not wanting to lump everyone in one category..and I do not think that ALL Sanders supporters are Bros, but the campaign has a culture issue that cannot be denied.  I want a nominee who is above the BS, and Sanders' movement has demonstrated the opposite."

11892,Yeah nothing wrong with it but don’t turn around and ask for a bailout later then..no such thing as too big to fail in my view
11893,"It is also a flat out lie. What OP is thinking of is the also very misleading claim that fewer Bernie supporters voted for Trump in 2016 than the number of Hillary supporters that voted for McCain in 2008. That part is technically correct, but it misses the bigger point. Once you consider 3rd party votes and Bernie supporters who abstained in the general, far \*less\* Bernie voters went on to vote for Hillary in 2016 than the number of Hillary voters that went on to vote for Obama in 2008. Non-votes matter too."
11894,"Yes, many of us here are voting Biden!"

11898,"Can I ask why you didn’t just take out loans to help you go full time?  I know the idea of debt is scary, but depending on your major, you could be doing yourself a disservice by doing the pay-as-you-go approach.


For example, if you’re currently making $18 an hour at your current job and taking seven years to get an engineering degree, that’s $37,440 per year.  Multiplied by seven years, that’s 262k in gross earnings.  However if you’re taking out $30k in loans to get that degree in four years, and come out with a $60k/yr job it won’t take that many years (roughly ten years total) before you earned more money lifetime despite having no income for those years you were full-time in college.


Perhaps you’ve already done these calculations/projections, but I just always like to remind people when they say “I’m working my way through school because I’m worried about debt...”.  Sometimes a little debt can help you jumpstart your career and help you achieve your life goals faster.  Sometimes, the super conservative approach actually harms you in terms of your career aspirations as well as saving for retirement.  Just want to make sure you’re aware."
11899,"We are craving Bernie supporters who are civil, decent , humble etc without mistaking their feigned altruism for those things whilst being objectively awful to anyone who disagrees. I think Bernie should address his supporters more about this but at the same time I think the ""Bro"" contingent is doing **Bernie** a massive disservice particularly

They make claims that they don't realise actually paint Bernie as an idiot or someone disloyal E.g. ""anyone denying Biden's obvious decline here is a traitor to this country and our movement"" ... What .. so Bernie then ?

I brought 6 votes of friends and family with me - and hopefully they brought some.

11910,"I also wish he’d legalize it, but he’s literally getting as close as possible without crossing the line. His plans are covered in his [Criminal Justice policy](https://joebiden.com/justice/) but here’s the relevant part:

&gt;	**Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions**. Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.

He also wants to end incarceration for drug use and increase funding for mental health and addiction services, in sort of related news. All improvements, even if he doesn’t cross the finish line."
11911,"I really want to believe this, but they were masssssively wrong in 2016. Hopefully they fixed their methodology and have it figured out now."

11918,"Imma let you finish, but the entire Kurdish Genocide was a complete and total 100% bald-faced fucking lie invented by the DNC who fed it to the media via their handlers as part of a fabricated narrative of falsehoods engineered to hurt Trump.

Literally nothing even close to what they claimed was happening actually happened. It was one week of sporadic border skirmishes and then it was over. It was all fucking fake. You were lied to, you gullible fucking moron. Why do you think they had to falsify footage of combat to run the story?

It

All

A

Lie

And

You

It

Because

You

Dumb.

Let me spoil something for you low information dullards... most of eastern Turkey is ethnic Kurdish. If they were going to genocide the Kurds why the fuck would they start by invading another country to do it and not by cleaning out their own country first?

You should seriously question what went wrong in your brain where you were fed such a preposterous story and unquestionably believed it. I'm going to guess it is because you are so mad about Trump you are *excited* to believe anything negative you are told about him.

Maybe instead you should question what other blatant lies you were fed, and you unthinkingly supported like the good little robot you are."

11928,Post like this make me uncomfortable. Let’s not get complacent.
11929,We’re in the endgame now
11930,There are some really interesting articles and political theory definitions of “progressive” and “liberal.” I definitely recommend a good google search because you’ll find some variance in different schools of thought.
11931,"I grew up in Florida and went to college down there. The big thing to keep in mind with Florida is that there are tons more registered dems than Republicans, it’s just dems struggle to turn out. If Biden can get the Obama coalitions out then FL can be a lock. It’s all about the gotv effort. Hopefully between Obama and Bloomberg funneling money into ads there, it’s looking good."
11932,"From a clean sweep for Joe perspective, is all.   Turnout was great!"
11933,"Yeah, how Paul Ryan even had the will to live after debating Joe is beyond me."
11934,Florida is Biden country!
11935,So many people dont know this about Joe and his public speaking is one of the main talking points against him. This article is excellent.  It goes in depth about some of the awkward words choices he uses that come off as lack of mental capacity...hes really just struggling to find a word he can say without stuttering.  It was really beautiful to read.
11936,"The solution is to have high speed 220mph+ rail between cities and then within cities (to different parts of cities) have regular trains or metros as well as regular buses.  From my house in London to go to a friend in Manchester, I take the train near my house to a central London station where I take another train to Manchester where I get on the MetroLink to my friend's house.  Cars need to be taken off the road and an integrated city wide transit system is needed, but most importantly, high speed rail for journeys between 200 and 1,500 miles is the fastest form of transport.

Most of the UK live in suburbs as well.  The national UK rail system looks like this. https://www.thetrainline.com/cms/media/2922/tocs-v52tl-december-2019.jpg That goes to every town with more than 50,000 people basically as well as a lot more towns.  It doesn't even include all the localised metro systems.  Cause the US is much bigger than the UK it means it is more efficient for the US and better for the US to use high speed rail and to get stations across suburbs, use 70mph rail to connect with hubs.

Most people need cars as well, but for a hefty amount of journeys high speed rail due to being 3x faster than cars is just much more efficient."
11937,"Ok this comment is kinda in jest, but kinda not. Can we sue the trump administration if we contract Covid 19? Did he do all he could with the facts in front of him to keep us safe? (hell no). Was this level of infection, death and shutdown inevitable, or could he have prevented a lot of it? (hell yes)."
11938,LOOKS LIKE RUST BELTS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
11939,His supporters are poisonous. I have heard people on the right compare them to brown shirts. While I would not go that far I can see parallels. And that’s just not an aspect that’s going to appeal￼ to the majority of Americans.
11940,"Joe Biden is so terrible, I will vote for trump. He is Hillary 2.0, establishment Democrat. In don't understand why the DNC is trying to throw the election again. I was a Democrat my entire life, but have since 2016, voted republican and will continue to do so till the DNC changes."

11944,What's hope and heal and beacon of light - does Joe have a plan here?

11950,Well no shit. But he isn’t entitled to have split competition. Let him earn it one on one if he is so popular.
11951,Sanders will not get healthcare done. Obama did all the intellectual heavy lifting that Sanders is not capable of.
11952,I've been hearing some talk that an announcement could come this week but who knows
11953,"I definately agree with you. Duckworth is a good choice, but there are better. Kamala would drive up African American turnout and butcher Mike Pence alive on a debate stage.  Klobuchar would mean that Trump has 0 chance of winning Minnesota. Whitmer would firmly put Michigan in Biden's column (I feel like he has that anyways). Honestly, I feel like Biden should make the choice himself. between these 3 if there are skeletons in their closet for some reason that we dont' know about, he should be able to vet them and make his best decision. 

I feel like Duckworth isn't the best choice because

1. the asian american demographic is very small and highly concentrated in states like california which well win anyways.
2. In a world as polarized as it is now, her entire story would not likely be able to break through. A short clip of kamala hitting mike pence hard would do rounds, but her story may be kept within political circles that have alredy made up their minds anyways. She's not a household name, and doesn't bring that much of an electoral advantage
3. We're going to win illinois anyways. No benefit there. (same goes for Kamala, though)
4. Perhaps the look of haivng a really old president and a disabled vp isn't the best look. I feel like some might be put off by that and may feel like the ticket is unstable

But I mean, she definately isn't bad, and if Biden chooses her, I'll be firmly behind them"
11954,Yes. I’m so illiterate when it comes to Reddit so I’m probably the worst person to ask
11955,"R-E-V-E-N-U-E

This is not a new problem. People have been trying for single payer for a long time and this has always been the hurdle. It’s why Vermont’s proposed system tanked. I mean, if you say that we already pay a lot, that’s true,  but individuals paying premiums and the government making that money in revenue are two separate things entirely.  And I see no improvement in people the same amount they pay now just to a different vendor. If you say, “we can pay for X that the government does, why not this,” find any current expenditure in the budget that is not a small fraction of what the estimated cost of M4A. Medicare works because it doesn’t cover everything that the M4A proposal does, and it still retains co-pays and deductibles. And people are able to buy supplemental insurance. Additionally, Medicare only works because it has negotiated to prices that are literally below cost. Health care providers take a hit and lose money,  and they are able to do so because they make money from non-Medicare patients. A lot of the studies Sanders points to cite this same negotiated price reduction as an assumption, which of course can’t stand if everyone pays below cost. The revenue problem has continually been insurmountable. When Sanders is asked, he points to his proposed revenue plan, which is fundamentally the same as it was in 2016. Even if you handwave some very questionable math in there and lack of detail, it comes to about $16.1T in ten years which is nowhere close to even the low end of the cost estimates we’ve seen. When Warren actually tried to do the accounting to get to net zero for her similar proposal, she immediately got hammered. 

We cannot continue to play this losing game of revenue hunting. What needs to happen is the US government needs to figure out cost controls from the side of HCPs and wrestle with cost limitations like Germany has. And we cannot do the necessary figuring out with the health of the entire nation on the edge of a cliff. What we can do is try it with people who are nevertheless uninsured anyway right now with a public option. If we are incapable of it, fine, but we’re not downgrading anything because the people are not covered to begin with. But if we are incapable with the entire population, most people will see worse outcomes than before. They will hate it will be politically dead. And we are likely to never again get a shot in our lifetimes.

If you want to talk about other nations, Canada has managed single payer, but they cover considerably less than the Sanders proposal does. The UK is on an entirely different path because doctors and HCPs are all employees of the NHS and hospitals are run by the NHS. I have no inkling of how that would happen here. You may notice I mentioned Germany before and their success with cost controls, and it’s the most interesting as a target for us, because it is essentially the ACA system, beefed-up and given teeth. And we have the structures in place to get there. I urge you to look into their program. .

Or you can look at this wall of text and the time I’ve considered and looked into this over the past three years and conclude that I don’t care at all and am actively rooting for poor people to die horrible deaths, as countless Bernie Bros have told me. I hope that isn’t the case."
11956,"A nice anti-malarky [polling bite summed up by 538:](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-views-on-the-coronavirus-are-shifting-fast/)

""According to Associated Press VoteCast data from the three states that held primaries on Tuesday, large majorities of Democratic voters supported a single-payer health care system similar to that proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders: 70 percent in Illinois, 72 percent in Florida and 76 percent in Arizona. **However, support for a public option — former Vice President Joe Biden’s preferred plan — was even higher: 87 percent in Illinois, 89 percent in Florida and 91 percent in Arizona.**""

Going to [the source](https://www.kff.org/interactive/the-role-of-health-care-in-the-2020-election/) it seems like the public option is more popular in all states they polled.

So when people come out with the malarkey that a public option is less popular than single-payer and that people are only voting for Biden because they're afraid of Trump but they prefer Sander's polices, you can show them that."
11957,"I'm also an Ohioian, you better keep that disclaimer up 😎😎 lol"
11958,"I'd add a new one to the list

NO MERCY FOR BERNIE"
11959,Biden shouldn’t participate.
11960,More misinformation.
11961,Biden has the luxury of not having to go negative on Bernie. It’s also smart as hell. Bernie’s attacking like crazy over social security and it’s a bad look.
11962,Biden's not dumb enough to assassinate a world leader. That's how you start World War III.
11963,Honestly biden needs these. His support with young people could definitely improve and I'm sure bringing these back would help.
11964,AOC is a great bridge!
11965,Ron Wyden has a speech defect? I'm also an Oregonian lol
11966,"Meanwhile the Bernie subs seem to have ""fuck everyone who disagrees"" as their official policy."
11967,For all those Delaney dudes on this sub
11968,Why doesn’t the EU like Biden?
11969,"He turned a bureaucratic, circle-jerking, out-of-touch Senate into an impressive imperial state. He didn't pull the trigger at Alderaan- that's the Moff's fault. Those hoodlum wannabes of the First Order can't be associated with the grand vision of the Sheev. r/empiredidnothingwrong"
11970,"Sigh. Man, you have no idea who I am, where I come from, what I’ve been through, and what I believe in. I don’t need you to respect me, and frankly, after the way you’ve treated me in this conversation, I don’t want you too."
11971,"Must be a shock when Biden keeps winning. “All my friends on Twitter, and all of r/politics support Bernie, I haven’t even met a Biden supporter i’m so mad at the DNC and the voters for rigging it against Bernieeeeee” - Sandersfan420lol"
11972,Yikes
11973,"It  wont work on mobile or old reddit, so make sure you’re not on one of those."
11974,"I feel dumb now, I should know what Inslee looks like. Thanks!"
11975,"PS.  I come to you all as a Bernie Bro who, at 17 years old in 2008, knocked on a hell of a lot of doors for Obama and his vision for healthcare.  What I came to realize over the next 8 years, was that the fundamental problem with ObamaCare was that it simply could not factor in the greed and profit motive of the industry.  A for-profit hospital will always look to maximize that profit.  And when private insurance can write a bigger check than the government, we know which one will win."
11976,"Spend the entire primary running down the Democratic party and calling your fellow Democrats Republicans, then lose the nomination. It worked in 2016."
11977,"There are mullings, Pete met with Biden campaign and the Obamas last night"
11978,I have not heard that at all. Does anyone have a source? I know they can refuse the secret service but I have no heard they do not get lifetime protection.
11979,"Biden earned quite a bit from a book deal as well.  He's also been paid for speaking at a variety of types of events.  Even if some are 'Wall St Types' those types are still an integral part of the economy, being able to have a working relationship with Wall St is important.  That doesn't mean rolling over for everything they want, but starting from an adversarial position doesn't get you as far as starting from a collaborative position."
11980,"Cash will get you attention, but your message and personality still needs to resonate."
11981,That was my opinion too- until I realized MA has a Republican Governor who is allowed to appoint anyone he wants to fill her seat for the remaining 4 years of her term.... he doesn’t even need to appoint a democrat. And the senate needs every blue vote it can get
11982,No malarkey-bo-barkey fe-fi-fo-farkey
11983,When he said that I was thinking... You know you can drop out you know.
11984,Bingo
11985,"I don't think Romney meets Biden's ""simpatico"" standard, so there's that. Also, while I get the idea here I don't think this sends the right signals to minority communities around the nation, to say nothing of his support for a constitutional amendment granting fetuses person-hood from the moment of conception. He also opposes gay marriage, so that's cool. 

Is Romney a person who I have many disagreements with but can respect on some level? Yes. Is he someone I think has any business on a presidential ticket with a Democratic candidate? Hell no. If for no other reason, we don't need a moderate Republican on the ticket to defeat Donald Trump. There's no reason to risk handing the Republicans the presidency by putting one of them with less than reprehensible character on the ticket."
11986,He would still be building on that legacy
11987,I was planning on voting Warren but am still torn between Biden and Sanders. I'm curious to know what solid Biden supporters think of Biden and his repeat bad interactions with voters. I agree the guy was full of shit but then he tells him to come out back and says he doesn't work for him. He also grabbed that guy by the collar and the whole IQ test/push up contest thing is just bizarre. What's his deal? What's your take on all this?
11988,"Im starting to think that perhaps the first amendment was a mistake, you have all these right-wing charlatans(president included) going around saying this virus is no big deal and we should ""get back to work"" as soon as possible.
Nothing can be done about it, this is ""free speech"", even if its going to cause a lot of harm to innocent people."
11989,"Hey! I see a lot of people posting here about Joe's empathy and his character-- but we have a lot of progressive policies too. You can see all of his policy plans listed out here: https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/

Some highlights though:

* Climate: Joe has always been a leader on climate change legislation throughout his career-- I'd really look at the video the campaign released about this nearly 8 months ago now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku7uZ0Gok2g
* Guns: Joe's the only candidate who's stood up to the NRA *twice* and won (the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban). It's the most important issue for me and why I personally got into the campaign. You can check it out here on the website: https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/
* Housing: Joe will work to protect tenants from evictions on a law modeled off of the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights (link here: https://joebiden.com/housing/)

I just picked three issues at random, but feel free to ping if you have any other questions. But I'm not gonna lie-- it's Joe Biden's character as the #1 reason I'm here. He really is a good, decent man."
11990,Why do all the betting sites have Trump favored over Biden?? To be fair Hillary was a huge favorite on these same betting sites over Trump back in 2016 so can't take them too seriously. I will be putting a lot of money on Joe...might be the easiest bet I've ever made. Join me.
11991,"Also, the more public speaking he does - more likely he will mess up.... a lot of people mess up. He prob gets nervous"
11992,lmao fuck off
11993,"&gt;Rove was clearly depending entirely on Romney's internal numbers, which ended up being a disaster for the campaign.

Let's hope this can happen again!"
11994,Be prepared for many more bad faith arguments from berners.
11995,"Remember Trump vs Hillary? Yeah, the dude is possibly more clueless now than he was then. Biden actually knows what the fuck he is talking about. Depending on what happens tomorrow I wonder if debating Bernie even makes sense. I don't think it matters as it seems the voters have decided."
11996,"I don’t think the entire party is ever going to unify around a candidate like the Republican Party does. Lefties care about voting for their values over intra party unison. And even though there is more people voting for electability over policies/ideals this year, I think that’s more just the more centerish dems finally unifying on Biden. Even if progressives were willing to vote electability over values, Bernie bro’s refuse to believe Biden has better electability in the general even as he extinguishes the bern in the primary. Forget even the primary, I’m worried about progressives being willing to unify in the general."
11997,"&gt; Pete tried to play nice from the start

No he didn't. Pete constantly talking over Bernie and insulting him and Klo at the last debate was a disgrace.  It's a shame (though a smart move) that Bernie played nice as that dude constantly acted out of line instead of lighting him up like he should have."
11998,"Priors? CONFIRMED
Succs? BTFO’d
Malarkey? GET OUTTA HERE JACK"
11999,Saying it came from Biden is what’s disingenuous.
12000,Perhaps. Although I feel like the Coronavirus won't be much of a problem anymore come November.
12001,"&gt; Bernie has been using his platform to raise money for COVID-19 charities as of late, and staying critical of Trump. I wholly support him in his efforts here, and if that’s what he wants to use his campaign for now, then more power to him.

That all sounds great, and he can do all those things while being a senator.

&gt; He knows it’s over, and now he’s using his revolution to help others.

He attacked Joe in the last debate and now he wants another debate. He’s also set up new offices in states that won’t vote for a while."
12002,Oklahoma and Utah would beg to disagree
12003,"It depends on the cohort 

Poor people are uninsured for financial reasons 

Young people are uninsured because they feel like their need is low

So you’re not wrong - both answers are right"
12004,"I said it once , I'll say it again. Praising Castro really fucked Bernie in Florida (as it should).

It may seem like ancient history for alot of us Millennials, but for many people voting, all the issues with Castro happened in their lifetime - they remember. The refugees fleeing, the Cuban missel crisis, the missing POWs, etc."
12005,"Exactly--we need to unite! Behind an actual Democrat who is civil and decent. But willing to fight. And while I wish it was Pete, I am convinced more after tonight, with Pete, Amy, and Beto behind him,  that Joe is the candidate who will unite us to victory."
12006,"""As our population ages it is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments... As Congress has done in the past.""

The adjustments he's referencing were expansions of SS, not cuts. So contextually he's more than likely talking about an expansion not a reduction. 

But that's the problem trying to us oped's as vague as this, you can interpret them however you want.


Ok seriously y'all stop making me defend Bernie it's making me feel icky."
12007,"[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avJ2Vpc8z0) you can watch almost the full debate, the person who taped it had some sound issues in parts of the recording.

In general Joe is for free public college and university for households making below 125k annually. 

Joe wants the US to rejoin the Paris Climate accord and lead the struggle against global warming, he however doesn't want to get rid of fracking or nuclear power.

I think what might be most important for you as a former Republican is the fact that Joe has shown that he can and is willing to work with Republicans. His message isn't about pointing fingers, his message is about unity."
12008,"Woah, he named a post office once."
12009,"Bernie's desire to ban nuclear energy was one of the few things I disliked about his plan, since nuclear energy is extremely clean, and, with proper precautions, the radioactive waste isn't much of a concern either."

12011,"+9 in FL, GA, NC, VA?!?"
12012,"Join the coalition, where all voices matter!"
12013,They're bullshit.
12014,"It’s good that turnout is high, I’m not sure what that means for Joe though. He caught fire late, and late deciding voters broke for him. 

I’m not sure what those early voters say and what date they started coming in etc 

Good that people vote for sure, hopefully they’re votes for Joe"
12015,"Biden has no cognitive decline.  He just stutters, and a certain toxic community feels it's appropriate to mock him for his disability.  It's despicable.

What I like about Biden is his ability to grow his base, win primaries, gain super-delegates, and unite the party while promoting an agenda that will actually be passed.

That's why Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Bloomberg are all on team Biden.  We're uniting the party, winning the primaries, and taking back the White House."
12016,"Obama/Biden never held the banks accountable for the suffering they caused.

One of the first thing Obama did after the end  of the Obama/Biden presidency was to give paid speeches to wallstreet.

Obama/Biden couldnt get a public option despite the fact that they passed the ACA through budget reconciliation with a simple majority.

People voted for Trump because they were disgusted with the ""normalcy"" or the Obama/Biden administration. 

You will be part of the reason I vote for the donald in November."
12017,"If Bloomberg being on a poster makes them stay home, but the prospect of  Trump getting another SCOTUS seat pick and thus getting RvW, OvH overturned and the SCOTUS ruling in favor of more executive power doesn't get them to vote. They weren't real progressives any way and we need not fear."
12018,"Left-leaning democrats : Get money out out of politics!(Not that i disagree, btw)
Joe : Ok."
12019,Bernie needs to concede. He's only helping Trump and helping covid 19 spread.
12020,"It's not like I was even posting on Politics or a Sanders sub. What motivation would I have to lie on the JoeBiden sub? For the sweet 64 Karma I got so far? 

Oh well, it's not a big deal. Some people don't want to believe others and there's nothing you can do about that. As long as we all move in one direction this November I'll be thrilled."
12021,This is damn near perfect. I think jim Clyburn should have been antman though. I can see why he was panther but still.. endorsement was.. *massive*😏
12022,The clients she worked for are public record. They have been for a long time. Buttigieg wanted to be able to hide the past clients he had worked with and what he was doing for McKinsey. Stop trying to twist things.
12023,"I hope this is true and find it encouraging, but until Election Day I’m gonna act like it’s neck and neck."
12024,lol true
12025,"Not knowing the language doesn't take away the fact that her father was of Mexican decent, and her grandfather was an immigrant.

Not knowing Spanish doesn't mean that millions of hispanics who share her story won't get inspired with her on the ticket. 

And there are thousands, if not more, of hispanics who don't even know the Spanish language, but are considered part and parcel of the hispanic community by reason of decent."
12026,John Kasich erasure
12027,"Nah its just Europeans like me trying to get some sense into the American voter. Bernie stands for everything a country should want. Its really not that difficult guys. It's like watching a bad movie. You guys keep running in front of the falling rock instead of just running to the side and be safe. Not here for a discussion, just wanted to let you guys know how the rest of the world looks at it. We're absolutely flabbergasted."
12028,"Right off the bat off to a bad start.

 I’m asking here because i want to know what the people think vs what the internet says. I don’t care about his website"
12029,"Smart move from Biden not to engage with Bernie at this point. He should look into general elections and centrist voters, not the ultra left wingers. Centrists are the silent majority and they are the one determining election outcomes."
12030,Amy is one cool cucumber!  I'm glad she is supporting Biden!
12031,I will NOT vote for Joe. No way in hell. I've been blue my entire life.  I went red 4 years ago and I'll do it again. Go ahead and make this POS my deciding factor.
12032,I'm listening to it now! It'll be nice to have a President who cultivates a strong relationship with Canada again (something I never thought I'd say).
12033,"&gt; and red states.

Wouldn't go that far just yet!"
12034,"Yeah, fuck those people who need ACA to survive, the important thing is that you don't have to vote for somebody whose ideas of healthcare aren't 100% in line with what you wanted"
12035,"Reminder: Don't get complacent.

12036,"Think bigger picture. It’s not just about Biden or Covid19, it’s about the lizard people creating distractions. Distracting us from their existence. I understand it’s hard to see at first, but once you start seeing them, you can’t stop"
12037,"Speaking generally I have a lot of friends who have left-leaning views. I view myself as social liberal which is left from the center but not hard left. So it's obvious that my friends who are politically interested really like Bernie Sanders. And they regard Joe Biden as an establishment politician. Although I agree with this sentiment I think that this is Joe's biggest asset when it comes to govern. 

But a lot of them love Game of Thrones. So maybe I am getting them a little bit warmer with Joe when I tell them that Joe Biden is endorsed by George R.R. Martin."
12038,Turns out spending your career helping others and fighting for others instead of yourself can pay off.
12039,"HAJSJJAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAJAJAJAHAHAHAHA HA

This shows how desperately few endorsements Bernie has"
12040,Yes!
12041,"A debate with Bernie isnt good practice for a debate with Trump. Bernie wants to debate policy Trump cant even spell policy. A debate with Trump is going to be a deranged old orange mad man screaming childish insults and making up bizzare lies. You cant practice a debate with Trump because no sane person can follow or predict his bizzare stream of consciousness rants. Biden just has to yell back at Trump and louder. He doesnt need to argue about, 4a or medicare 4 all who want it. He just needs to call Trump a lying dog faced pony soldier when Trump calls him crooked and digs up some bullshit breibart conspiracy theory about Burisma."
12042,"Yep, deep blue seat in Chicago."
12043,you love to see it
12044,"Yeah, Our Revolution seemed pretty hypocritical if you insist on all politicians being elected through raising their own small donations"
12045,"I think the left side of the party will get some concessions, they’ve made their voices heard. They ran a good race. Hopefully Bernie decides that there’s no path to victory here and rallies for unity."
12046,Who’s the guy 2 from his right?
12047,"This is the greatest thing I've ever seen, laughing my ass off right now. Well done"
12048,Sorry to rain on this parade. But really curious. European here. Why dont you guys want free healthcare? What's that all about?
12049,"The fact that anyone thinks that Biden is a good idea shows how corrupt our society is and how low the bar is for “decent.” Joe has been on the conservative side of every major battle the left has fought.  he’s the wrong choice and he won’t even make it to November.  Hillary 2.0.    

Waiting for the ban hammer for speaking obvious observable truth."
12050,"We gotta face some harsh realities. Bernie Sabders will not be the Democratic nominee. He is behind on delegates and will not catch up. He did not attack Joe Biden near enough to flip anyone in the upcoming primary. It's uncomfortable I know, but I think Bernie supporters need to get their priorities straight and (like Bernie will) endorse and volunteer and donate to the Joe Biden campaign."
12051,Anyone else enjoy laughing at the Sanders sub?
12052,"Why not do a Biden/Sanders ticket? If it is truly about beating Trump, it probably can’t get any better than that."
12053,Doesn't that just demonstrate sexism is a bigger obstacle than racism? Plus look at how much more attention that a candidate that was a mayor of a small down and also gay got compared to the female candidates this time. It seems like any kind of man does better than a woman.
12054,Not an American but does this mean I am going to see less Bernie posts on front page. I respect your democracy but I have a strong feeling that Bernie is using Reddit as a tool for his campaign. Nobody would give so many awards for a post where Bernie seemingly saying something obvious is praiseworthy.
12055,"Great list! 

Didn't Biden switch his college plan to 4 years free for public colleges a couple of days ago? I didn't read the whole plan but saw that headline."
12056,"Thank you, happy to be here!"
12057,Why can’t you answer that one question that I’ve asked you numerous times?  You would literally vote for Trump over Sanders and you say that I’m not a democrat?  🤦‍♂️
12058,"&gt; Sanders fans going to go to town with

... anything. They're immature, hate-filled kids."
12059,"I'm inclined to be more generous.  He lived his 2016 March to the Sea.  It didn't do anyone much good, least of all him.  I think it's likely that he's just learned from that experience."
12060,"I don't know how you repay the guy if what Van Jones said is true

Apparently Clyburn gave Joe some straight talk, and helped him get his shit together. You saw an awesome townhall, debate and a fantastic and gracious thank you speech. Jim saved his ass."
12061,That's funny I know the policies of my candidate you dont. You are soewi g hateful negativity and outright lies about another candidates platform. Last time I checked you were the one calling others uninformed. I never mocked anyone you on the other hand.
12062,"I'm terrified that when the crisis ends he'll take full credit and send checks home to many Americans and buy their votes. Then again, he could just tank after the coronavirus hits republican states and his approval goes down. I'm hella anxious"
12063,Is there much/any text banking for Joe?  Would much rather do that than call people but didn't see anything when I googled it
12064,"As a Trump supporter, I hope you guys get your party back together soon.  A strong opposition party is good for the country."
12065,"The irony though. You support campaign about bringing people together, but gatekeep people ""jumping on the bandwagon"" as other candidates drop out. That's the total opposite of what political campaigns, specifically Biden's, are meant to do. The whole point is to bring new people in, ffs, don't undermine people for being new."

12071,"I know this is about NC, but looking at 538, if the margin could frankly be 31/21 in favor of Sanders, I'd consider that a major win. He won't dominate the delegates THAT much."
12072,"Again, you are discounting millions of voters which is what contributed to the 2016 loss. So far, Bernie has gotten 5.8 million votes and will increase as he stays in the primary. Obviously, Joe will need all the votes he can get for the general."
12073,"Bernie had his one on one, he spent the entire time attacking Joe's character and record, he then bombed in all of the primaries that followed the debate.

Joe is right, it's time to move onto the much larger problems of coronavirus and Trumps dysfunctional leadership."
12074,"Hooray! More talk and less action, let’s go Joe Biden :) thank GOD the only candidate who gives a shit about the working class is almost of the race. For a minute there, wealthy people almost had to pay their fair share in taxes! Thank god Joe is here to protect the Billionaires, isn’t anybody thinking of them??"
12075,Pretty cool actually 🍦
12076,Same here.
12077,"Why should other people have to pay your retirement (social security), infrastructure, public education, police and fire services? 

What does the economy look like when an entire generation is so saddled with debt it can’t buy homes or consumer products? 

The *mob* capitalizes interest weekly. The federal government on student loans, daily."
12078,The character that a lot of people see as Biden is just absolutely so off base. He can and will do a lot of good once we get him into the White House.
12079,"I understand that it’s hard for them to mail everyone a check when they don’t know where they are (or whether they don’t need it because they’re wealthy). Doing it based on taxes is an easy way to get it done quickly since you have the name, address and income, but definitely doesn’t cover everyone. Hopefully there’s more aid coming in the near future to help the most vulnerable people, this one seems like blanket economic stimulus rather than helping the needy."
12080,Maybe we can find out from the Republicans in 2024.
12081,Incredible response!  Thanks for posting it.
12082,"Damn, must've missed this the first time around, what a class act. YangGang here but damn happy to be alongside Pete supporters - both give me faith in the long-term trajectory of the party."
12083,"I honestly think they are right now, for both Biden and Bernie. I think there’s a decent chance that either of them would be 1 term presidents.

IMO, Bernie in particular should be seeking out a successor. Biden’s got all kinds of moderate successors waiting in the wings, but if Bernie keeled over tomorrow is there anyone who could step in to keep his movement going?"
12084,"I like his platform (progressive policies that actually stand a chance), I like his empathy, I like his experience. He's maybe the most heartfelt person in politics and that's exactly what we need in a leader right now."
12085,"pretty much this.. 


I voted for Hillary knowing that she was qualified. 



There were a lot of people that did not vote for her just because she is a women."
12086,What about Yang?
12087,Don't hold your breath. Same exact shit went down in 2016.
12088,"this is why I don't like how Joe recently trying to pander to bernie's camp. They are not worth paying attention because of their turnout votes and most of them most likely are living in CA or NY which is worthless in general election. 

They are loud and obnoxious online, they dominate reddit, twitter,twitch, and any other online social media space, but in real world, they are as relevant as dirt"
12089,"I totally agree with you there. Also, the same can be said for Bernie at times. He uses the same trick over and over again of pivoting to his stump speech and would normally get a cheer every time, without that he just looks desperate."
12090,"These have been coming all day, so here's the answer. Everything you want is going 2 be apart and parcel of the Democratic part.

Sanders wants to do thing at 150%.

Biden wants to do mostly those same things at a realistic 75 to 100%.

Ultimately there's very little different between the 2. It's just mostly wise and scale. Bernie a lot of stuff quickly. Biden most of the stuff, at a realistic pace.

Also it's not wise 2 offer any personal information online, unless you really know people. I've had personal threats online where people found my location. 

The less random and angry people know the better."
12091,"The average voter in Belgium would pick Biden over Bernie. Candidates like Bernie in Europe have been slaughtered in recent elections (Corbyn, Melenchon, the Greek far left). 

Bernie subs have been spreading lies about Europe in part because they are infested with Russian trolls who are trying to destroy the EU and NATO.

Bernie people say the same thing about Canada but the Canadian Green Party has never won an election and the Trudeaus are very close to Obama and Biden, as friends and in terms of policy.

The Russians want Americans to believe that every other country is socialist so that they divide the US and it’s allies. Don’t fall for it."
12092,"He won because of racism, sexism, I would argue classism, and the such. Thought that was an article of faith across the left, center-left and center? And he won because of resentment of the ""PC culture"" which intends anyway to try and combat that, and ""affirmative action"" was the original gripe over ""PC culture run amok.""

I'm just warning you, he's going to make hay around how we made it clear we were only interested in Black women, and how whoever Biden picks, checked the boxes and got ""special treatment."" And a lot of middle America will say, ""Yeah, he has a point, I hate that worldview."""

12095,"For what it’s worth, Pete Buttigieg is expected to endorse Joe Biden tonight. That’s huge!"
12096,"I really don't see what Harris brings to the ticket. She's from the sapphire blue state of California and she was kind of weak this election cycle. She was hyped up so much before the election and then just crashed and burned. Because of that I'd be worried about making her Biden's successor (assuming he hands the reins over after one term).

Here's the article that was referenced BTW:

12097,"He's *trying* to manipulate them.  It won't work and Trump will lose in a landslide.  What he needs, though, is help from redditors saying things like ""Bernie's supporters are *have played* right into Trump's hands,"" which also isn't true but sure as hell benefits Trump."

12100,"Maybe, maybe not.

Some may just sit out if anything.

I won’t, but wouldn’t be surprised to see some voter apathy hitting in."
12101,I saw that! Welcome to the team! Team Pete is so pure I’m glad you all are joining the Joementum!
12102,"But he'll probably get independent and moderate-leaning Democrats who may otherwise vote for a 3rd party or a sane Republican.

Look at Biden's platform and then get back to me that he's not offering anything that Bernie voters want. This 'All or Nothing' mentality is a huge turn off. American politics is about compromise."
12103,Can’t believe I voted for her for Secretary of State in 2014. She’s changed a whole lot.
12104,"Just saw a CNN piece that said Bernie was proposing delaying primaries because of covid-19. That really screams 'give me more time to dig out of this deficit' to me. Not good optics, using an international health crisis to benefit your campaign. The moral thing would be to concede now and end the election. Surely the DNC could say that with only one candidate remaining, that candidate having the majority of earned delegates, and given the current crisis, we're moving forward with Biden as the nominee."
12105,"Great points. Former Pete voter (although Warren was definitely my #2) and I align closer to Bernie than I do Biden politically but I can't get behind Bernie's divisive tactics. His ""everyone is wrong but me"" and ""I won't compromise on anything"" is going to give us 4 more years of the same divisive political garbage Trump brought us and isn't going to move this country forward. Bernie has some great ideas and certainly has the ability to be unifying but he refuses to do it while letting his internet tribe do the dirty work of tearing down his opposition. Remaining silent on it doesn't give him impunity from it. Pete, Warren, Yang, Biden, etc would have never stood for that. Ever. And it's part of why I liked them. 

It's so short sighted. You can't simultaneously mock and belittle people and treat them as stupid if they don't agree with you and then yell at them when they don't immediately align with you when their chosen candidate is gone. Turns out that bullying people into agreeing with you doesn't work. More importantly, we are above it.  I can't handle this ""the end justifies the means"" attitude and the justification that things are so serious right now that we have to be angry and spiteful. No. Just no. You can be angry... we all are. But there is no justification for this childishness and maliciousness, especially being aimed at good people who have done nothing wrong but disagree with how to reach the same goals. The way that Bernie supporters are treating Warren right now is abhorrent and it's a huge turnoff for me. She's done so much for this country and deserves so much better. I can't handle 4 more years of this division and name calling and I can't bring myself to support any campaign who will tolerate it.

I'm sort of proud of the Democratic Party and the candidates who see how this will end and are putting the past political differences aside to present a unified front. It has become clear to me in the last two weeks who the grownups in the room are. Biden has my vote."
12106,I voted Republican in the primary in the 2016 primary and democrat in the general. This time around it’s democrat both times.
12107,Excited to have you with us. Can't wait to knock on doors after convention to get Joe elected.
12108,"Hey thanks for popping over, here's a general summary of his policies:

7, 11 and 8 should interest you! Someone else can tell you about environmental policy but Joe is pro Nuclear energy.

1. Universal healthcare through a public option, as well as the standard Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, ending out-of-network surprise billing, etc.
2. Legalization of marijuana, no incarceration for drug possession, banning of private prisons
3. $15 minimum wage and indexing it for the future
4. Reinstating DACA and creating a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants
5. Overturn Citizens United and go even farther with a constitutional amendment
6. Increase income taxes on the rich to expand social security benefits and maintain solvency
7. Increase taxes on corporations to pay for a tax credit to cap all rent at 30% of income and a $15,000 tax credit for the purchase of a first home
8. 100% clean energy by 2050 just like everyone else, I don't really understand the nuances of different environmental policies unfortunately
9. Ban the sale of assault weapons, universal background checks, closing loop holes... basically the same gun platform everyone has
10. All companies must provide at least 12 weeks paid family leave
11. He is a little weaker on student loan debt. He only supports debt-free community college and he will just expand PSLF, double Pell grants, and reduce interest on repayment plans. Does NOT go anywhere near as far as Pete, Warren, or Bernie on this."
12109,"She campaigned a lot actually. Only time she didn't was when she was called for active and duty and now. She completely stopped onced the Coronavirus began. She was really a people person campaign, so she didn't have as much money as others. Not only that, getting shut out of debates and town halls didn't help. I'm proud of her and look forward to her future."
12110,"Biden is a corporate whore who has been and is a stooge for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, wall-street and oil &amp; gas. He's a fucking whore who sold his soul for political power and he won't do a damn thing for ANYONE who isn't already rich. He's a fucking loser and a lying bastard who is more of a Reagan Republican that a Democrat. Too bad lots of people are so fucking stupid they think he'll be different than Trump. Biden is the same bastard who has been trying to cut social security, medicare and medicaid. What the fuck is WRONG with people?"
12111,We should get a debate. Make it an undercard.
12112,"People: If Biden gets back Michigan and Penn from Trump without losing any other state, is game over. Penn is singlehandedly the most important state in the battle to come. Joe has to go ALL IN for his NATIVE STATE."
12113,"Welcome.  We came from every Democratic campaign, but we are united in the goal of kicking Trump to the curb.

12119,"Medicare for All is only popular until you define what it actually is; an abolition of private insurance. At that point, it becomes overwhelmingly unfavorable. And the reason why is obvious. Universal health care has been done the world over, and it's almost always accomplished with a hybrid system of the sort Joe Biden has proposed. Few countries have actually abolished private insurance entirely, and most of those that have are actually socialist or communist. Not good optics. 

We know what works."
12120,"I just posted this above, but European systems still involve the private insurance industry. If you were to listen to Bernie, he intends to shut it all down the moment he steps foot in the White House.

Hate sanders all you want but he is the reason we moved that 1 degree left overall."
12122,"his base of support is limited by geography not demographics.  all of his support is concentrated around the college campuses. they don't reach the rural and suburban areas. his Iowa results exposed him.  MN confirmed it. Nevada was a one off due to the union and Las Vegas population.  So they can get as mad as they want but they simply don't have the numbers.

12123,"You know what? You're right. Some people will misinterpret perfectly clear things that are spelled out to them, and the guy should know that. All I was trying to do was: in case somebody comes in here with that misinterpretation, maybe they'll see past it. That's why I haven't questioned a SINGLE thing Biden's ever said in here. My point was not to argue candidates or policy, only to shed some light on a misreading of the opposition."
12124,The governor of Illinois could probably buy and sell Trump's entire family. I think it's more that Trump is a petty narcissist who has no fucking concept of what it means to be a servant leader.

12128,"I'm just going to say like it is, and your not going to like it but I owe you an explanation. 

You are in the minority. 

I was a YangGang guy, and still am but the way that Bernie supporters bullied us, made bad faith arguments against us, and simply lied predisposed me against y'all. This is freaking Yang, who is quite possibly the only person comparably progressive to Bernie running and yet they attacked us. 

The memes are accurate, Bernie built his coalition around young people who didn't show up for him and his base demeaned so many people that we certainly didn't vote for him. When Yang dropped out I voted for somebody else completely, it wasn't Joe and it definitely wasn't Bernie. 

So yes, I'm sorry you are being caught in an overgeneralization, but you should be aware that just because it's a minority of you guys that are toxic it's not exactly a 1% kind of thing. A substantial amount of your base attacks us, demeans us, and is simply rude. 

I agree that we should not make these attacks as supporters of Joe, in fact that was my single favorite thing about Yang supporters is that most of them were truly kind, and the toxicity needs to stop. 

Ftr, I didn't downvote you, someone had already done that and I put you back up.

12129,I'd love to see Sanders asked about this at the debate - show that his ad with the fake Obama endorsement is crap and remove any veneer of association with Obama
12130,"A year or two ago she said she wasn't interested in being president and ""hadn't given much thought"" to being VP. Just putting that out there for what it's worth."
12131,Bernie and his campaign are salivating with each one.
12132,Hopefully it’s just coping right now
12133,"&gt; Say it is $200, and that's a big if.

If your payment is $200/mo under Biden's plan, you'd have to first be making $75,000/yr. You're not exactly impoverished. And yes I did read your original comment, and lenders will understand that you're on the hook for $200/mo as opposed to the full amount you'd owe without income-based repayment.

&gt;The Warren plan would wipe the slate

Only for you and your cohort. It does nothing for the next crop of private school students.

You're worried about what happens if Trump 2.0 says ""fuck IBR"" but don't mind that the Warren plan doesn't even need Trump 2.0 to fuck future students, it just needs Warren 1.0."

12135,"It's bizarre to me how Bernie caused conspiracy theories to be main stream among his followers. For instance, So many conspiracy theories already. Many Bernie bros believe the DNC(Mostly incompetent underpaid 20-year-olds) control and rig everything. I also heard a guy with a degree in political science diagnosing Biden with dementia on Joe Rogan. It's been very bizarre."

Yeah there are a bunch of foreigners - but the ones I have talked to said stuff either that they love Bernie and his message so much that they really care about it succeeding or that American politics has a massive affect on their politics. Some would move to the US if he was elected and managed to enact even one of his reforms.

12146,I am trying to start a discussion on Joe's climate policy. I was a Bernie support and am still a big fan of his though I know he can't win. I tried making 2 different posts and they were both automatically removed. I first one was a little harsh so I changed it into more of a discussion but it was also removed. I just wanted to know what peoples thoughts on his climate policy were and bring some insight into how I view his policies as a 21 year old.

It’s highly questionable whether it would even be constitutional to admit DC as a state, Puerto Rico should only be added if approved by referendum, and, even if they become a state, will likely be a swing state.

12165,"You're right, it's not protesting.

I don't know how, but in the last few years a lot of people have started to think that protesting is about disruption and inconveniencing people in order to force them into capitulation. While protests can be disruptive, that wasn't their intent. It's only this new wave of activism that sets out to disrupt and uses protests as their method.

I usually call it bullying. In this case though, I think we can call it a riot -- of one."

12168,"Look at voter turnout for Biden, which is at record levels in many states. He’s rebuilding most of the Obama coalition, but there’s definitely more work that needs doing to get younger voters on board.

Biden doesn’t have sexism playing against him like Clinton did. He doesn’t have a 25-year propaganda campaign of conspiracy theories against him like Hillary did, either.

He’s winning white working class voters again, as well as suburban women. Whatever dirt Trump tries to throw w/Hunter &amp; Ukraine has failed to stick so far &amp; the House Dems can investigate the Trump kids the minute the Senate tries anything against Biden.

This country knows that Trump is incompetent now. It’s not 2016 anymore. We still have to work hard to win, and win big enough to get the Senate back."

12183,"Biden doesn’t know anything about guns though. His comments about how “all you need for self defense is a shotgun” are not only wrong, but his advice about warning shots was and is illegal everywhere in the US. People have gone to jail for doing exactly what Joe recommended.

As a former gun control advocate, I can tell you that it’s a position rooted in fear and ignorance, and people like Joe Biden leverage that to push a statist, authoritarian agenda that has nothing to do with safety. It’s all doublespeak, lies and nonsense. Get a gun, take a class, get educated. Once the fear and ignorance are gone, you will see how wrong most people are about gun control.

It’s a shame how many other countries rolled over and licked their masters’ boots while giving up their weapons. America is the exception there and frankly I’m proud of it. You can feel pity for us  if you like, but understand hundreds of millions of us feel the same about you."

Here's an article discussing that role call amendments are largely irrelevant:  

&gt;The standard language of this type of provision goes like this: “Page X, line X, after the dollar amount, insert “(reduced by $X)(increased by $X).” There’s nothing binding on the agency in question to spend the money a certain way. While ineffectual in practice, such amendments can hold symbolic value: they allow sponsors to tout their influence on the spending process, including in official descriptions circulated in advance of the vote and in floor speeches and news releases.

12187,"Yep. I'm just hoping the current populist peacefully leaves office after he loses his election. Other countries haven't had the best of luck with that (article from 2018): https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/hard-data-populism-bolsonaro-trump/578878/

&gt; According to our research, populist governments have deepened corruption, eroded individual rights, and inflicted serious damage on democratic institutions. ...

&gt; Here’s how we formed our list: We selected 66 leading peer-reviewed journals in political science, sociology, and regional studies; identified all articles published in these journals on the subject of populism, as well as political leaders linked with populism; then vetted each potential case study, consulting with country and regional experts. Populist governments, in our working definition, are united by two fundamental claims: (1) Elites and “outsiders” work against the interests of the “true people,” and (2) since populists are the voice of the “true people,” nothing should stand in their way.

&gt; Ultimately, we identified 46 populist leaders or political parties that have been in power across 33 democratic countries between 1990 and today, giving us the ability to settle the theoretical debate about the tension between populism and democracy in a rigorous, empirical way, on a global scale, for the first time. The results were alarming: Populists are highly skilled at staying in power and pose an acute danger to democratic institutions."
12188,If he wins the presidency he would be the most liberal president in the past 30 years
12189,"I genuinely believe it’s a matter of getting things done. Contrary to popular belief, Biden is running a progressive campaign in comparison to ones in the past.

He has great relationships in the Senate, and during Obama’s presidency was able to get Republican votes, and even convinced Arlen Specter to change parties.

I understand that Bernie has popular policies, but he won’t pass or pay for any of them. Joe will get all of his policies accomplished, Step by Step."

12195,"He really needs to tone down on the attacks, the more he does it the more likely the “Bernie or bust” movement does their “Bernie or bust” shit."
12196,Stickied post on sanders for president at the moment is how Sanders will come back to win the nomination...
12197,It isn't over until its over.  Fuck outta here with this until then. At which point convince us to vote for someone who is against most of what we're for.
12198,"Bernie not doing more to try to reign in those types of supporters (some of which are his own paid staff ) is undermining his ability to pick up voters from campaigns that have been suspended.  I honestly didn't think Bernie Bros was a thing in 2016... but after a couple of months of rats and snakes on twitter and how obnoxious his supporters were to the Culinary Union in Nevada?

Yeah, no.   I'm for expanding Obamacare to have a true public option and I think at some point we'll get to a place closer to Medicare for All.  But I can take a big pass on much of the rest of that platform."
12199,"With mail in ballots, it makes sense that the first results would strongly favor Sanders as the moderate votes were still split; that's why the numbers don't add up to 100%. By contrast, people mailing in their ballots on Tuesday (and why things are still being counted) would be more likely to favor Biden.

Go Joe, Go!"
12200,"Tbh, if you don’t like 4 more years of Trump, VOTE. Hold Joe, Congress and the Supreme Court accountable.

And its too early to say that Trump has no ammo against Bernie. The reason why nothing’s coming out is simple - Republicans never saw him as a threat. Not in 2016, not even today. The Republican strategy is simple, witch hunts. Benghazi then, Burisma now. Bernie would not have been exempted.

Trump committed impeachable offenses just to dig dirt on Biden.

Also, as if voters really do care about his alleged “cognitive decline.” Trump won. All bets are now off the table. The standards are so low now that I don’t see this becoming an issue. The turnout for Joe is obviously massive notwithstanding smear campaigns of his alleged “disability”"
12201,"I'd love a Pete endorsement, but until it happens I'm not going to count on it. I like Pete, but while the press calls him a ""moderate,"" I think he's positioned himself more like a quarter of the way between Biden and Sanders. Closer to Biden, but I'm not sure he wants to provoke the wrath of the dirtbag left if he can help it."
12202,Hope all the networks air this daily instead of that poop show from Trump.
12203,"sure he gave them 10 times, he will give them for the eleventh time.

12206,"I actually felt this as a gay man, but from others in my own community. The lgbtq subs skew pretty young, so there's a lot of Bernie Bros, and they act like I want my rights taken away because I'm not voting for Bernie.

Then of course they bring up the video of Biden saying that he didn't support gay marriage. Yeah I remember, I watched that debate live. And I turned around and voted for his campaign, because I understand how politics works. If you don't get elected, it doesn't matter what you supported, you're done.

It's a shame that Bernie's campaign has gone so negative. It really sets the tone for his supporters."
12207,Of course &lt;3
12208,"Sometimes I wonder, is it really Bernie holding out or is it the potential backlash from his more extreme supporters the thing that's keeping him in?"
12209,Calling shitty regulations and policies corruption is not smart. What is legal but bad is not the same as criminal behavior.  He traffics in this mislabeling and I don't get why he does it. I don't think it gets him more support but it does push people away.
12210,That's the sweetest thing ever. Honestly super wholesome

12212,"Sure we should. We should be at 100% renewable energy and not releasing any greenhouse gases at all, but we're not even close to there yet. If you like low gas prices then you should be at least a little ok with it for now. We've become the world's leading supplier of natural gas after fighting wars over oil the past two decades.

12216,The half that hasn't voted is even more pro Biden than the half that voted.
12217,"Senator Baldwin is an experienced woman from Wisconsin and she's certainly qualified for the position as well. There's nobody from Florida like that though.

With regards to drawing voters in, I think Biden can do that just fine on his own. Also, winning Wisconsin may not be that difficult as they've recently elected Democrats to statewide offices, went for the Democratic candidate in every election from 1988-2012, and are [favoring Biden in the polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/).

At a certain point, it just comes down to personal preference and who Biden believe would be best for the job."
12218,"An addendum should be added to address the Ukraine controversy Trump has manufactured, since that'll be Trump's biggest attack against him should Biden win the nomination."
12219,No he shouldn’t.
12220,The person who wrote this article seems juvenile. I think Joe’s debate prep team doesn’t need to read this. They have things well in hand.
12221,Those are just the initial delegates that they can estimate. It'll be calculated when the votes are counted.

12225,"Well, Trump likely would not have voted to invade Iraq like Biden did, but otherwise, they are pretty similar."
12226,I want one 😭
12227,You can't have to people over 70 on the ticket. It just isn't a viable ticket... Especially if Trump taps Nikki Haley.
12228,"&gt; So you’re telling me you believe this stuff?

&gt; I’d like to have a civil conversation and see why you think the way you do

K.

You come in all a-ragin', shouting everyone down, then ""want to have a civil conversation"". I suggest you try that tactic within your own movement, and ask why young voters aren't turning out for your candidate, or why the only endorsements from former candidates are DeBlasio and Marianne Williamson, or why only ONE fellow Senator has endorsed him (his state-mate, Patrick Leahy). How do you think he will get his agenda through if the Senators he needs aren't on board with him now? Or are ALL of them ""rigged""?"

I know it sounds grim... but I really hope his VP pick is solid as a rock, should they need to take over."
12233,"The bigger the pool of payers, the cheaper the insurance is for everyone. That was the concept behind the individual mandate. That, and to incentivize people to enroll. If you have to pay either way, why not just have insurance?"

12235,This. Or HUD. Or SoS.
12236,Did you hear about this guy Pete? Heard that he regularly meets with a cabal of billionaires in an underground bunker to further the oligarchy agenda. Isn't it scary?!?!
12237,the people have spoken
12238,Wow.  You are a Joe Biten supporter.
12239,I read something in another political subreddit today that said the old notion of picking someone who can complement what strengths you don’t have (minority/woman/progressive/age etc) actually doesn’t hold weight with the stats. VP pick barely mattered for getting more voters. Is there a short list for Joe? I’ve seen Kamala/Amy tossed a lot. I know it can’t be Warren (senate loss too great).
12240,"I’m not big on blind party loyalty, but as a conservative I can honestly say that I will never vote for any current democratic candidate ever. What policies exactly won you over, or is it just that Trump offends you? Poor Joe. It is so obvious to everyone else that he has dementia or something. You’re voting for a VP that he hasn’t even selected yet."
12241,Agreed. Unfortunately we can’t even get adaquete testing right now under the current regime.
12242,Either an agent or a useful idiot.
12243,I don't think that the majority of his supporters need him to endorse Biden.  Most of them will vote blue in November because they understand what is at stake after three years of Trump.  The ones who do need that probably cannot be swayed anyway.

12248,"MN and Mass both have systems, not perfect, but cover just about everyone if they fill out the forms.   adding a public option and passing HR3 would be big help.   Why M4A, IMO, is unworkable is because the Health Insurance Industry employs 2.4 million people.  Nationalizing it would cost Trillions up front.  So it makes more sense to use these systems and enhance them.  MN built its own system and its really decent.

12250,Hmm possibly but I think warren could really motivate women to vote. Yang really doesn’t have that mass appeal yet. Young people aren’t reliable.
12251,"Thanks for the response.

12252,Imagine being such a trash candidate that you cant get an endorsement from the man you were VP to
12253,"You want to talk about lies? Yeah well they believe in any crazy thing he says even if it is not based in reality so maybe you are right. 

People who think Bernie's policies or Medicare for all can get passed, even though Bernie has only opened 3 post offices in his 30 or 40 years in congress, are like the Trumpers who believed Mexico will pay for the wall. 
How can you reason with people who think every ""corporate dem"" and ""establishment"" dem that Bernie has called names and made enemies of for the last 30 years will all, to the very last one, vote for his policies. Legislation requires compromise and we all know Sanders refuses compromise."
12254,"lmao I had to rewind this morning because I realized halfway through the interview I had stopped actually listening to what anyone had said and was just absentmindedly basking in having him back on my TV again

apparently Pete Buttigieg is my safe place"
12255,"We already are seeing amped-up activities and the intensity of these attacks.

I am hoping that Bernie proves me wrong, but I am not too hopeful."
12256,"The only mention I’ve seen of it is about halfway through his [Criminal Justice Policy](https://joebiden.com/justice/):

&gt;	**Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions.** Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts."
12257,"Blame Sirota. He started the 'White male privilege' narrative early as a journalist before he even got hired by Bernie. That's what knocked him from 12% to 3% in two weeks and he never recovered. By the time Jen was hired it was too late and the narrative set in. 

We tried corrective actions over the summer...but another candidate in the 'moderate lane' started sucking up all the media attention and it was too late. We were starting to get a spark again after El Paso, but by that point we ran out of money.

C'est la vie"
12258,"Warren's voters aren't a cohesive block like some of the other recent drop-outs are. We won't see them moving en masse, regardless of who she endorsed."
12259,"Not trolling anybody bud, I’m a registered independent....I despise Bernie....back in 2008 when I was a Democrat I voted for Joe Biden in the primaries over Obama....


But it is clearly obvious that Biden’s mental capabilities are failing, he reminds me of my 83 year old grandfather who has dementia. 


It’s so blatantly obvious that this entire sub is ran and promoted by paid DNC social media workers. None of this support is organic, it’s actually truly remarkable to watch you guys shill so hard, I know in 2016 Share Blue was paying you guys $15 an hour to shill for Hillary Clinton on social media - hopefully they’re paying you more now because it’s much harder to pretend Biden is a good candidate 😂"
12260,No one is saying “never Bernie”
12261,"Canada, and the rest of the world, watches as people vote for a person who is not going to hold up on their platform promises. 

People actually forget that politicians will lie to get into office? And when they succeed, the backpedaling becomes impossible to ignore?

I love humans but I swear America is some grandiose social experiment in ignorance, propaganda, and greed.

I really hope actual progressives in America refuse to vote when it comes to the presidential election. Some lessons can only be learned the hard way. Enjoy your next half of decade, choosing between lying garbage and lying garbage."
12262,And they are ultimately going to fight like fuck to beat Trump. They’re just going to need a minute before they’re willing to gear up for the next fight.
12263,Even Richard Nixon reportedly couldn't figure out why his people would bother breaking into an organization as toothless as the DNC.
12264,Of course. We can’t let Trump win a second term.
12265,You sound like a shill
12266,Excited to see how this debate goes! Go Joe!
12267,Normally that would be the case. But these are not normal times and a good economy will not cause Joe to lose.
12268,"I hope we can avoid using derogatory language to describe Sanders. Sanders is intense and very passionate about his beliefs, which often manifests itself in misguided ways, which definitely causes problems, but I don’t think that makes him an asshole."
12269,He was the most progressive he wanted to give everyone a minimum salary whether they worked it not!
12270,"There are two things that can be very hard for some people to say.  One is ""I don't know"" and the other is ""I was wrong"".  I have a lot more respect for someone with the humility to admit it, AND the introspection to change based on new evidence than I do for someone who simply doubles down.  I've been wrong before, we all have.  I try my best to admit when I'm wrong, figure out why I was wrong and do better in the future.  That's just being human."
12271,"Agreed. The reasonable ones will back him for the most part. The unreasonable ones will never be won over no matter how many concessions are made. Focus on turning out the AA voters and suburban women, Diamond Joe!"
12272,"We're up in 4 key senate seats (NC, AZ, ME, and CO). We have good candidates. We could also pick up one or two in GA, and now that Bullock is running we might get Montana! Wildest dreams is 53 senate seats for dems. Realistic is 51."
12273,I'm over thirty and I'm vaguely aware of Twitch is.
12274,"I meant your split in the youth vote. Like the percentages going to Biden and Sanders in youth votes is pretty spot on for that demograhic.

It was just cool to me how accurate of a split it was."
12275,How’s the turnout in your area?
12276,Bernie lost to Hillary. Bernie lost to Biden.He cant beat Trump . End of story.
12277,"Sanders will not help us get the senate to flip blue, he doesn’t talk about it because he doesn’t want people to realize all his plans are totally down the tube unless we elect some senators he doesn’t personally like for one reason or another.  Sanders stance has been FU if you’re not totally with me on my issues.  That doesn’t work at all w the three branches of government.  Biden has a wide coalition, he will do everything he can to flip the senate.  That makes this easy to anyone who actually followed politics longer than four years, but Berners have not."
12278,"I guess. He'll make a lot more progress dividing us. Many Bernie supporters will vote for Biden without question, many don't even vote, the small amount who are selfish enough to spite vote for Trump aren't enough to sway the election. There probably aren't even enough to sway one state."
12279,"Get in, champs! 😎🍦"
12280,is gay marriage really the social issue to compromise on that's gonna bring people around? how many conservatives are still against gay marriage after all the evolution society's gone through on it but willing to vote for a pro-choice candidate? i'm guessing very few.
12281,what now?
12282,The first polls close at 8 pm ET (7 pm CT).

12287,"I’m sorry for your experience. This is kind of personal but I think I’ll share it just so you can see where I’m coming from.

My mom has PTSD from being raped by her dad when she was 2. She dealt with it by using marijuana. Most people don’t get addicted to it, but she did. She tried to quit, but relapsed after several years clean. This was all before I was born. She used it, unbeknownsed to me, during most of my childhood. It got worse after my dad died. She would sometimes just go upstairs and kind of be missing for a while. She cycled between overly easy going and being irritable. At one point it was found out by a social worker and she went to outpatient treatment, but didn’t really try to get clean. Then, things came to a head. She was smoking on the way to her longtime therapist, who smelled it on her. She, being a mandated reporter, called child protection. They said that she had to return to outpatient treatment or they would take me. She went, finally got clean, and feels so much better. She’s been clean for several years now. Still to this day, though, she has a bad sense of smell because of all the smoking. The experience that I’ve had is nothing compared to what many people go through, but based on my experience I just can’t support legalization."

12290,"I relate to both of your sentiments--the crushing hopelessness brought about by recent primaries, as well as the moments of extreme determination to get Bernie elected through a re- organized, unprecedented effort. However, I decided to focus my energy on the latter, not because I've deluded myself about his chances, but because as a therapist, I know the dangers of hopelessness and helplessness. When expressed, although completely valid emotions, they spread and  influence others who may be clinging to hope, to give up. If Bernie suspends his campaign,"
12291,I mean you’re literally offering them a change to earn a vote for you I don’t get why you’re being downvoted
12292,Why do you think it would be a waste?

12294,"These are literally Trump/Republican talking points. Look, I've accepted that Biden is going to be the nominee but why can't we just actually hold ourselves to the higher standard we want Republicans to? Why do we immediately call women liars if their accusations are ""inconvenient?"""

Funny how this thought process works on both sides of the aisle. 

I was initially a Warren supporter. At no point did I ever buy into her being forced out or whatever. She didn't win because, despite what I thought, she did not connect with voters."
12301,"that particular poster got upvoted a lot in your subreddit. 

He literally implied that Joe should have stepped aside and he got into Pete's way. If you disagree then my post wasn't directed toward you, it was directed to Pete supporters who feel the same way, that Biden should have fucked off and made a way for Pete. 

 I thought we put aside our differences, but there are some people like that poster who still hung up and can't face the fact that their particular candidate didn't have a chance to win the election. 

Joe is too nice, he sent his regard to you guys, and this is how some of you reacted? I can also bring things I don't like about Pete but I don't do that anymore because we have bigger target right now, like bernie and trump. It is just annoyed me seeing a petty comment like that on Pete's sub."
12302,"And he'll get Dems elected down ballot so we can get a majority in the Senate, actually get shit passed, and take goobers like Ted Cruz out to pasture!"
12303,"I don't agree at all in this situation because it is not apples-to-apples. Joe appeals to white, latino, black, etc. etc. Bernie does not appeal to Black voters yet continues to tout his background on civil rights. This is intellectually dishonest and he, more than anyone, needs to reach out to this community but instead as abandoned them."
12304,"Thank you for sharing this. I grew up with a speech impediment, and the toxicity from Berners on this has been incredibly hurtful. I opened up about it publicly, privately, and on social media with many people I know who support Sanders. And I told them how hurtful it is to see people attack Biden's cognitive abilities because of his stutter. Yet many of them are still going on about it. Man, it's just fucking painful to watch them do this."

12312,"How could you possibly support this man? I dont support bernie because if who he is, I support him based on the need for America to move into the new world we helped to create. 

Biden is opposed to Medicare for all. How can you continue to support a candidate that refuses to stand up to the corporate establishment? How can you be so down right mean to your fellow, birthright, citizens? Why are you able to become monsters? 

When the time comes, and you or a loved one becomes sick, you will wish you didnt have to shell out what you cant afford. 

I feel sorry for you all, and for my own predicament. I would have thought that seeing people dying everyday would have been a wakeup call that said ""dont vote for the person who is in the midst of cognitive decline"". 

Every single one of you has betrayed the American dream. I hope every single on of you feel the ramifications of this choice. 

How could you let this happen? We are fucked now."
12313,"I think (at least I HOPE) that the whole ""Bernie or bust"" thing is an outlier.  I'm a 2016 Bernie voter (who voted for Hillary in November, naturally) and I still do and will always like him.  But he's not going to win, so that's pretty much that.

Also I'm very glad Yang ran, we're richer for his ideas.  UBI wasn't even a term on anyone's lips before, now even the current administration is considering it, at least as a temporary stopgap.  He also brought into the public discourse the issue of automation and how it's changing our labor landscape and that issue is NOT going away.  I have nothing but respect for what Yang fought for, and will continue to fight for.

It's time to come together and remove this terrible stain on our country.  We need to stop the bleeding, then we can work on the healing."
12314,"Also I feel like back room deals aren't really Bernie's thing and frankly it's still too early in the process to really be able to offer anything of substance beyond a handshake deal. 

At the end of the day we really want the most qualified in the administration, not necessarily the ones with political connections."
12315,"I feel like we’ve been trying to push for background checks and closing the gun show loophole for a couple decades now...A complete refusal to cooperate with *any* regulation or even discussion is very frustrating.

12323,"What I really want to see is Biden do well in the Midwest. He will make me far less nervous about the general election if he can win in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So far so good, it appears."
12324,What?!? No way. It's not April first .. Don't mess with me.

12326,Warren supporters are the backbone of the Democratic Party.
12327,"1. Most of my time here has been spent trying to make posts and comments to help those on our sub be as informed as possible about Joe's current standing in the race. Mostly I've contributed to conversations about new polling, speculative analysis about future races, and ensuring posters on this sub don't fall victim to the misinformation and toxicity that many other candidates' communities have become surrounded by.

Additionally, Joe is the only candidate who can beat Trump, expand the Democrats' voting base, keep the House and take the Senate in 2020, and I wanna make sure that happens as much as I can!

2. Eastern Standard Time (Upstate NY)

3. Yes! I was the moderator of a small subreddit of a gaming community dedicated to foreign language learning.

4. I think I should be a mod because I'm a person who's main focus going into 2020 is making sure that whoever our nominee is (hopefully Joe!) that we maximize party unity. There's no time for protest voting or misinformation and toxicity. The Democratic Party is America's only chance at returning to normalcy and a time of compassion that we've lost, and I want to make sure Biden is the person to do that. Additionally, my own ideology is a relatively balanced one. In 2016 I had favorable views of both Sanders and Clinton, and when she won the nomination I did my best to make sure my pro-Sanders friends understood the importance of not sitting out the election or voting third party. I think this gives me an important and unique perspective we need in this race and in this community to ensure Joe wins the nomination with as much support as possible, and that Democrats don't fall into a trap of resentment and anger when the convention concludes."
12328,Nice use of purple.
12329,My heart wants Hillary but my brain knows it won't happen
12330,"I'd have a drink with the dude, seems high quality."
12331,"Sorry to hear you had a friendship end over politics. I have life-long friends from all over the political spectrum. We get into spirited political discussions from time to time, but none of them are going to end our cherished friendships over some political disagreement that, as individuals, we realistically have virtually no power to make a real impact on anyway. Frankly, we enjoy poking fun at each other regarding our politics, and are good spirited enough to take those occasional silly jabs in stride. I value the diversity of opinion and ideology I get to experience from my friends, and I feel we're all better people for it.  Using hate and divisive rhetoric as the vehicle for promoting an ideology ain't gonna win any converts (which is why you see a lot of folks in this sub and other more ""moderate"" leaning ones talk about its absurdity so frequently). Your friend (or ex-friend) could benefit from a re-evaluation of their life priorities in my opinion, and I won't be surprised if they turn around after a bit of a ""cooling off"" period. Keep your head up and don't compound the hate by returning it (Joe wouldn't tolerate that kinda Malarkey! haha). Take care and good luck! :-)"
12332,"Many of them, at least here on reddit, aren't about arguing in good faith. Unions are a talking point to them, when they're pro-Bernie they're good, when they're pro-Biden they're corrupt or part of the establishment or whatever. People here aren't trying to change minds but get imaginary points to validate their own beliefs. I'm glad to here Biden has such strong support among the working class, I just wish the other guy's fans wouldn't frame it as them ""voting against their interests"" when they choose someone else."

12337,"Yes, because the deaths haven't ramped up and they haven't spent a month staying-at-home.

The ""it's a hoax"" ads will start after."
12338,"He is by far the closest. And we on the left are not naive about him or about electoralism. You don't elect communism. Bernie Sanders was a wedge in the closing door of capitalism. With him, the boot would have been taken off of labor just enough to maybe get things going. Wildcat strikes, solidarity strikes, pressure against right to work laws, workers and union members with seats on corporate boards. The potential gains could have been enough to shift the power in labor's favor for the struggle that was always going to have to be fought by the masses. With Biden those hopes all but evaporate."
12339,"You know, I just noticed my comment here was being downvoted. I was agreeing with you... I thought this post was a rebuttal to Sanders supporters saying that Sanders was right all along, by pointing to when Biden was right.

12345,"Really? How much progressive legislation has been enacted in the last four years? Have we made any progress at all responding to climate change? Has the nation's healthcare system been improved in any way under Trump?

Meanwhile, the SCOTUS and federal courts have been packed with Trump-appointed far-right idealogues, environmental protections have been gutted, the ACA has been hamstrung, and wealth inequality is worse than it's ever been. The Trump administration has set progressive causes back by decades. By any measure Trump's election has been a disaster for progressive ideals."
12346,"Yeah, Biden doesn’t do great with the young, white, educated male demo aka Reddit. 

Let’s hope he can try to energize them if he wins the nomination"

Also what exactly is his healthcare plan? Googling it has me confused"

I suspect he knows he has no chance of winning a contested convention, he wouldn't really have any choice but to drop out. The superdelegates on the 2nd ballot would overwhelmingly favor Biden."

12367,"WOW, coming out calling me illiterate for one comment; this is absolutely wild. Biden's worldview has changed with the times, yes. He's shown that he's open and willing to learn based on new information taken in and life experience. I'd think perhaps he falls into the P (perceiver) category on the MBTI vs. J (judger). I commend him for coming from a closed-minded social group and growing into who he is today. Personally, I don't like people who are obstinate, dig-their-heels-in, fingers-in-the-ears stubborn and unwilling to compromise."

12379,There's a segment that did it last time too. Most will vote Biden if he's the nominee
12380,What time
12381,People generally don't misvote. Voting is a costly activity and the individual returns to it are small. People generally vote for people you want to vote for or not at all.
12382,"Biden is literally a man with NOTHING to offer. He answers no questions, he just rambles on for hours trying to sound clever, and brain dead Americans actually believe that he is."
12383,I don’t think there will be any field operations.   This one will be 100% digital.
12384,Texas is in a runoff between MJ Hegar and Royce West to challenge John Cornyn. Runoffs are in May(as of now).
12385,"I'm not OP but after Biden won SC, Sanders supporters claimed that the coloured electorate were  the dumb black people of the country. Some people were advocating their votes be discounted because they are 'low information voters'. Unlike the Sanders supporters, who must by default be intelligent and informed before us mere mortals. 

A lot of Sanders supporters have been aggressive about the possibility of Buttigieg endorsing Biden. They've been calling Buttigieg a corporate hack/shill for a long time but this really amped up their complaints. 

Sanders supporters have been bullying unions that endorsed different candidates, because if you don't vote like me you must be my enemy and I'm prepared to destroy you. Charming.

I'm on mobile but I'll try and find the pictures soon and link them if you want."
12386,Greetings fellow YangGanger!  Welcome!

12399,"I see your concern but I am talking about the choice in healthcare insurance- the choice to choose their provider, and other choices. No one can choose to get injured or not. Life hapoens.


And the cost of insulin was directly due to a pharmaceutical company monopolizing their profits by using buybacks to drive up the stock price. This used to be illegal in the 80s but is no longer. This is what I meant by wanting capitalism but wanting effective caps and legislation so no monopolies can continue."

12403,Yep I reported it.
12404,"Joe is for free public vollege for those making under 125k, and is for some forms of student loan forgiveness."
12405,Really happy to see Biden winning back Grays Harbor County which has gone exclusively Democratic for President from 1932 to 2012. That and Pacific which had gone for Bernie but voted Democratic from 1956 to 2012. We need to bring both counties back in the Democratic column.
12406,"Your argument was that the Green New Deal was a poor economic choice, but Biden's plan is heavily the green new Deal. Also the Green New Deal will have a negative effect on GDP. Put simply if it was the smartest move for the economy: businesses wouldn't need governments to come in a force it to happen.

But if you are going to do something like thos, making sure the that jobs created are at least quality jobs is a good way to do that, and bernies plan promises 10+ million more than Joe's, while being a more aggressive time scale to achieve everything.

And you say that we are ""on the same side"" yet you trash the person that support things like gay marriage long before Joe Biden did. It a ""populist"" stance when it's not popular and ""moderate"" when its safe to vote for. Sadly if we listened to ""populists"" ages ago we wouldnt be in our current mess."

12408,You’re right and I do intend to vote blue no matter who. But I’m hoping it’s Biden!
12409,"It's a lose-lose situation.

I am personally staying home. Staying away from people. Until we can get a vaccine, cases start going down, whatever. I'll stay home until I hear it's safe to go out.

Do I want people out and voting? No. I want everyone to stay home so that more people don't die.

But it's also true that I don't want any precedent of canceling or stalling elections at the last second. We're all against Trump. He's has authoritarian tendencies. I pray that he won't try to do something like this in November.

It's just not an easy answer. None of this is fair."

12412,Last minute mic checks are being done
12413,"She's been playing interference for Biden for the three debates (attacking his major spoilers) at least, so I think she could tilt to him. Bernie hasn't really helped her in any way so it doesn't really make sense for her to endorse him."

I would expect to lose WA, ID, and Democrats Abroad tomorrow.  We may even lose ND (voters are largely college students). All will be close, but it may give Bernie good press.

Democratic socialists do not believe in capitalism 
https://www.dsausa.org/

&gt; Capitalism pits us against each other and workplaces are fundamentally authoritarian unless workers can self-organize and build collective power. This is why people build unions, and why employers undermine them. It is also why the capitalists as a class constantly promote narratives about unions that frame them as unnecessary, undemocratic, or ineffective.

12425,"If people aren’t working but their debts are still accruing (even if payments are deferred), there will be a long period of “catching up on bills” once we get back to some semblance of normal. None of that will help improve the economy in any way. A stimulus package should, in theory, stimulate the economy, and relieving a substantial amount of debt from millions of people is an excellent way to do so."
12426,Good job citizen!
12427,Luckily you can enjoy another 4 years of Trump all while voting for Biden along the way. What an exhilarating exercise in futility!
12428,I'll vote for the compromise!  As a moderate I'll always take forward movement and improvement.

12452,"Watching the republican primary in 2016 was a good lesson. There were a lot of good candidates who had reasonable and common sense ideas. There were a few I would’ve been happy, as an Independent, to have as my president. No one wanted to listen though. They didn’t want someone who was knowledgeable, reasonable, and measured. They wanted a savior. They wanted someone to swoop in and fix everything right away. They picked the person who yelled and bullied, because they thought he’d defend them fiercely as well. They picked someone who’d steamroll everyone in his path. It’s fair, and I get it...but there are no saviors. 
That’s not how this works, and no one man can fix everything for us. Steamrolling people just creates enemies and division. I can’t vote for another person who wants their way or no way, and who will relentless pursue their agenda even if it’s not necessarily the best way to go. 

I like Bernie, but I just couldn’t vote for him. I’m tired of the attacks and the blaming, and want someone who is respectful of others and just wants to get some work done. And I totally agree that he separated the party. We had several good candidates, and it just turned into an effort to stop Bernie."

Life has dealt Joe a shitty hand at several points, so much so that it would break a lesser man, but he instead poured his grief and frustration in to helping people.

This is why it infuriates me when people say Joe Biden doesn't inspire people. When I watch Joe Biden talk about his first wife and his daughter, or his son Beau, or how his parents raised him, he inspires me to try to be better. Of course he has his angry old man moments; everyone does. And of course he gets really passionate about some things, everyone does. But over the course of his career, Joe Biden has helped more people than everyone else in the field combined, both legislatively with things like the Violence Against Women Act, and personally, such as when he gives his personal phone number to a kid with a stutter to call when he's feeling down and needs a little help. And I'm not knocking the other candidates here, I'm just trying to explain why Joe Biden IS inspiring, at least to me, in a way none of the others are. And to be told by some he's ""boring"" or what have you, it's just so mind-numbingly irritating."
12466,"Yeah, she was top 2 for me, especially after Warren gave me some anxiety with the DNA test. But then Warren continued to impress and Gillibrand didn't during town halls."
12467,"That town hall question is probably the single thing that first flipped me from ""my candidate isn't in anymore, guess I have to vote for Biden to block Bernie, but I don't really like Biden either....."" to "".....okay wait hang on this might be okay after all"""
12468,Which makes the lead even bigger! Imagine Joe leading despite a conservative figure??
12469," https://youtu.be/zCKcw5yvMw0
Just gonna leave this here."
12470,"I think it’s going to be Harris. Her and Joe’s families go back a long time and they seem to genuinely like each other.

I like Whitmer a lot, but I heard her say a week ago on TV that she’s not going to be VP. Things change of course so we will see."
12471,"OMG.

I just bought the Tweet less, listen more tee-shirt yesterday.

I.CANT.AFFORD.ALL.THIS."
12472,"Well, he avoided the draft so..."
12473,A specter is haunting r/JoeBiden
12474,"""Don't laugh Jo-""

""HAHAHA"""
12475,"It's sad. They should know better than that, but some of them really are no better than Trump's worst followers. It's not about the politics to those people, it's about their specific candidate and hurting anybody who isn't them."
12476,"idk the job of the DNC. it's weird to me that a private company can basically become the government. In UK, parties are publicly funded so are liable to the public. I mean reactions are great, like Nancy Pelosi tearing up that speech, but American politics is all theatrics, meanwhile Kurds are being killed and European countries bombed in retaliation.

Out of curiosity to you and all my bideners here:

What do you think of a constitutional reform? ie: scrap the 2 party system, or make some changes to bring it up to date, does the DNC not being publicly accountable bother you?"
12477,No malarkey Mr. Biden!
12478,"SCOTUS is a reason to vote in November. It’s likely that whoever wins will get to replace RBG and possibly Breyer. If that person is Trump and we end up with a 6-3 or 7-2 conservative majority, it will close the door to progressive policies for 30-40 years. How much progress do you think we’ll be able to make on healthcare or climate change if the court nullifies every law we pass?

For me, enacting Biden’s platform is a starting point to tackle our problems, not an ending point.  There will still be a lot of hard work left to do. But even if SCOTUS appointments were literally the only thing he accomplished his entire term, that’s still reason enough to vote for him."
12479,"Let's hope Bernie does the right thing.  

I truly believe he's a decent man who will make the sacrifice, unite the left, and join us in fighting the real enemy: Trump."
12480,"This is another very nice endorsement. I've really lost count of just how many endorsements Joe's gotten over the last couple of weeks.

We need a master list at this point. 

But the Herald will do very, very nicely."
12481,"""That's just the MSM trying to deny Bernie airtime because they are scared he will make a come back blah blah Biden once ate a poor person, blah why do you hates poor people, blah they are trying to hide the fact Biden is really dead and using a body double.""  

Jesus, I couldn't imagine how the next month would suck even more until now."
12482,I’m think this won’t happen.  The party *needs* Warren in the senate.  A vacant senate seat is appointed by the governor.  The governor of Mass is a Republican.
12483,"those people are an extreme minority is my point. last time most of them plugged their nose and voted for hilary. but now...even as a life long democrat voter, I know for a fact that if sanders isn't on the ticket i won't be voting within the 2 party system. enough is enough."
12484,You cant compare randy moss to a child predator that cant make a full sentence named joe Biden.
12485,"I'm not that concerned about Michigan.  Sanders voted against solving the Flint water crisis, and we have every endorsement of note in the state from politicians to unions.  The latest poll had us up by 6, but Bloomberg, Warren, and Klobuchar are still in it.  Distributed, it's a &gt;10% lead.

Sanders is fighting for his political life, but we aren't letting up.

Superdelegates only vote on the second round of a contested convention.  At that point, Bloomberg, Klobuchar, and Warren delegates are also free to move.

I agree we need at least the plurality, and we will get that."
12486,"Not when she uses the position to attack the DNC, which is what she does with her current Fox appearances."

12490,"Joe should drop out. Btw, where is ol joe anyway ? Fondling kids in a cellar somewhere ?"
12491,"With Biden's dominance and Klob/Pete's fizzling after NH I think voters will move to Biden naturally. Klob should stay in to compete with Sanders in Minnesota. The biggest threat is Bloomberg: a weak Bloom performance will be what we need to pull of wins in Texas, Florida, etc."
12492,And to think even a week and a half ago it was a fraction of that
12493,Thank you for making this point so concisely I totally agree. The idea that *that* was a bridge too far? When we are just writing off everyone’s loans like it’s nothing and freebie handouts are the norm? OK.
12494,Something is wrong with that model. After April Sen. Sanders' delegate count have some probably to decrease

12498,"I want a sane leader, not some Leftist revolutionary who cannot get along with his own party."
12499,"I mean yeah I asked you if it would hurt to be a more positive rep for the campaign and I guess the answer is yes. That doesn't give you license to insult me, dude. If this is how you want to be that's fine but it would be cool if we tried to avoid acting like the worst elements of the Bernie camp."
12500,This. All the artful dodging doesn’t change this.
12501,"I could get behind Amy as VP. She could help deliver the Midwest 

I’m still holding out for Pete as VP, but for purely selfish reasons: I love the idea of Dr. Jill Biden and Chasten as First Lady and Second Gentleman. Could you imagine two educators spending the next four years advocating for the well being of the next generation in such a profound way? 

I just love that everyone is rallying around a unity ticket right now regardless of who lands where. I was a Pete guy, but I’m genuinely excited to vote for Joe tomorrow."
12502,"&gt; Also, they are polling during a crisis, and a crisis president should be doing better.

But even during a crisis, he isn't doing as good as other crisis presidents so that gives me hope as well!"
12503,Kinda a slow news night.
12504,"Not trying to be mean, but what are you googling?

12505,"Biden with 63% of the African American vote 

We were told all primary that Bernie was favored with African Americans - that was bullshit. Joe is going to dominate that vote"
12506,"You should probably do that, yeah, thanks."
12507,This is your brain on Trump propaganda.
12508,"Duckworth has historically always indicated she's not interested, her name has come up for VP and President a lot over the years. It'd be out of character for her to suddenly be on board with it now."
12509,She's doing remarkably well for someone with so many dire health problems.
12510,Thanks
12511,"Mandatory buyback was polling at 50% in Texas. But I get why other people didn't want the fight, things got loud online for a while."
12512,I like the analogy. Hopefully Bernie’s boat can pull a little harder over the long run.
12513,"A Warren VP pick would open Biden up to attacks from the GOP for being too ""socialist"". He might pick up some progressive votes but they dont outweigh the wins he would have from Republican leaning indepedents. A Warren VP pick would push independents away.

Also Warren isn't on the same line as him. He needs someone on board with his ideas."
12514,"No doubt. Although I’m glad they had the debate on Sunday, there really wasn’t a ton of need for it. It gave Joe some good practice for the general election, but there was not much upside for him to engage in it. After tonight there’s absolutely no need for another debate. Bernie isn’t a serious candidate now, and he won’t be in the future."
12515,"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/biden-running-mates-143124

The most important thing, and I've actually talked to Barack about this — the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,” said Biden, who is 77.

Biden said he needs “someone who is comfortable with where I am” on policy. He doesn’t want someone with “a restricted view of the United States and its required influence in the world” and wants to make sure his pick is not “at odds, in any fundamental way, with my attitude toward healthcare or education.”

Also this. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-has-talked-obama-about-possible-vice-presidential-pick-n1166231

He then added, ""But the second criteria is I would very much like my administration to look like the country, like Barack and our administration looked like.""

Election politics do not matter to Biden.  He wants a woman of color who’s with him on healthcare and education and who can step in and lead immediately if necessary.   Harris fits the bill better than anyone else at this point."

12527,Here's how Bernie can still win
12528,"Seems pretty split between Joe and Bernie in Lancaster. Pete had some support, but usually only as a ""I'd be okay with him but I want &lt;insert name here&gt; more."""
12529,Idiot.
12530,"It's kind of logical, until you consider that a supreme court which by then will be 8/9 hardcore conservatives will never allow a single progressive policy to happen until the 2060s at best"
12531,Thanks. You've actually made me question my neverbiden stance.
12532,I think 2 (?) polls this week actually had Sanders unviable so ya never know
12533,People voted?
12534,"You can really see the Bernie-friendly changes 538 made to the model after Super Tuesday by how little the listed averages have changed even after recent seismic polling shifts.  For example, their national poll average is listed as just Biden +6.4 despite two recent Biden +16 polls and no real poll under +6.4 since Super Tuesday (the ones including non-voters obviously don't count).

Even so they're giving Joe a 97% plurality chance.  Which is fine, I don't necessarily think that's too low or anything, but more because a double-digit national polling miss seems at least vaguely plausible given the volatility of primaries, rather than because Joe is really only 6.4 ahead right now.  

Though I dunno...the polling is really pretty nuts, these are Kerry '04 ""the other guy has no shot whatsoever"" type numbers.  Even a 15 point miss in his favor isn't enough to give Bernie a good night, and a 15 point miss is enormous."
12535,"Will we hit 10,000 subscribers today?  So close!"
12536,"I think for the cognitive issue, at least to me if you pay close attention it's not that he's not making sense, it's that he jumbles words, but the reason for that imo is his stutter and vocal control is getting worse with age, which happens but has nothing to do with his cognitive ability. So when he uses obscure phrases it's because he wanted to use a word that he didn't used to pause on but now he can't use that so it's an awkward transition period for him. That's at least how I've seen it"
12537,Which makes Bill Clinton kind of amazing. BTW if you could hold a Red State Gov as a Dem it would really help at a run.  Up hill battle but Montana and Kentucky both have Dem govs.  Its more about policy at the state level.
12538,Awesome!

12541,Jim Webb: How dare you!
12542,"Yep. If Bernie were a real leader, he could have been the unity candidate! If he had adopted a more positive, inclusive approach to his campaign, he probably would have already won the nomination practically speaking. But instead, he chose, as usual, to be divisive and bitter and angry. That only works for his base, but doesn't appeal at all to anyone else.

This is all on Bernie, and it's because he is a cult figure, not a leader. We need leaders."
12543,Yeah seems like the sources got mixed up
12544,"Everyone on the Internet supports Sanders (Reddit), Warren (Twitter), or Trump (4chan)."
12545,Yes.
12546,"I believe everyone would be in a better position so that's why I'm not going to vote for anyone except Bernie so that I can fuck over tons of people just so I can appear ideologically pure 

But tell me again how only Bernie supporters are compassionate towards the poor and children in cages."
12547,"&gt;It reads a little like hey we already have the support of black voters so why should we give them any real representation in the White House? 

It reads like a person shouldn't be elected just because of the color of their skin."

12553,"I’m a Bernie supporter too, but I don’t support his more rabid fanbase anymore. Joe Biden doesn’t have dementia. People need to shut the fuck up with that nonsense. Now a bunch of them are already indirectly supporting Trump and they either don’t realize it or they don’t care."
12554,It says in the as it’s from a PAC
12555,"Looks like the curve is flattening on publications interested in or running with the Reade accusation that the Biden camp adamantly denied as false. Newsweek is the new outlet today doing so but don’t give them the clicks. The momentum of it certainly seems to be slowing rather than gaining and now and I’m glad they came out with a statement. Hopefully by next week things will have moved past it and back to Coronavirus and everything else going on.  

The minute it becomes just Trump vs Biden the story largely becomes irrelevant anyway because it becomes 20 accusations from Trump and video of him saying he does that to a single accusation  from a Warren turned Bernie supporter who begged Bernie to stay in and then came out with a brand new story hoping that it would help him enormously that all in the Bernie bubble ran with.  

Get this primary over with and on to the General Election!"
12556,Love it!!
12557,Biden has spoken with several governors about the coronavirus pandemic including Gov. Jay Inslee (WA) and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (MI).
12558,"The Bernie bros have been downright bullying and abusive across the spectrum.  Of course it's going to turn people off.

Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Warren stuck around through the 17th just because of this."
12559,"And I suppose just that sentence is being shown without any context...this is where social media can be dangerous. Read, research (from a wide variety of sources), and don’t rely on quotes and memes to form your opinions."

Of course, it was also upvoted to the front page, because the hivemind."
12562,"Most never were Democrats. The hardcore socialist stuff is not part of the Democratic party I've known my whole life and I'm old af. Their strategy was to take over  one of the big two parties since our winner take all system doesn't really allow third parties to succeed. 

They hate both parties equally and they thought Democrats were dumb and weak enough to let them dominate. If it wasn't for the AA community saving our party, they might have succeeded."

I’m afraid I’m not the right person to answer this because Pete was my candidate of choice so to be honest with you I think that I am hopelessly biased. 

That being said all my friends and family members who are black are firmly on board team Joe and don’t seem to have any preference for who he picks up his running mate. When I’ve mentioned Pete to them the older ladies seem to have complementary things to say, my dad and brothers all love that he was in the military and the younger folks still just don’t know who he is. What that tells me is that I think that he would be perfectly fine and complementary addition to the voting block that Joe already has locked up, I don’t think he would turn off any of Joe’s voters, what I don’t think he would do would be excite the super young voters but TBH they aren’t showing up anyway. I do also think that he would convince a lot of Republican and rural all voices to come aboard.

12579,Welcome!
12580,"Welcome! I’m a fellow Sanders 2016 supporter, although I supported O’Malley originally, until he dropped out. Also, I was too young to vote. I turned 18 in February 2017. This election I started out in January 2019 supporting Warren, then I switched to Castro in February, then back to Warren in September, and I switched to Biden in November. Sanders is definitely left of where I am, but his foreign policy is my single biggest issue with him. In 2016 it was less known and the Venezuela thing hadn’t happened yet, but even knowing everything I know now I still would support him over Clinton. Anyway, I wrote this little essay about a month ago on why I think Biden is the best choice. I’ve posted it way too many times in comments and stuff, but here it is in case you want to read it.

Biden is the strongest candidate on foreign policy. He has a deep well of experience simply unmatched by other candidates. As I’m sure you’ll agree, Trump has done serious damage to our foreign relations. This is a uniquely difficult time in the world, with democracy under threat from the rise of authoritarian nations and Trump has sided with dictators and has isolated us from our allies. Biden knows these leaders. He has spent time with these leaders. More than that, he truly understands the importance of NATO and democracy promotion. He understands that the actions taken in the next four years could likely determine the course of this century in human rights and global affairs. He is particularly strong on China. Biden has spoken with passion on the treatment of the Uyghurs and will make human rights an important issue in US-China relations, as it should be. He is the only candidate with a detailed plan for responding to a potential Chinese invasion of autonomous Hong Kong. He supports reviving something similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but with more worker’s rights protections and anti-outsourcing measures to create a powerful trading block of Pacific democracies to compete with China, and he has stated a willingless to consider options up to and including sanctions and economic isolation to pressure the Chinese government. He knows that a strong America is good for the world, and that the world’s democracies must unite to combat the tyrrany and corruption of nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. He supports using our considerable soft power, I.E. diplomatic influence, to push for justice. This is also the only true path to lasting peace, as democracies don’t go to war against other democracies. He rightly has strong reservations about using our military to solve problems that do not have a military solution or could be solved through diplomacy. He strongly opposed and argued against President Obama’s troop surge. 

Outside of foreign policy, he has the longest and strongest record of actually passing progressive legislation. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act. He helped pass the Assault Weapons Ban. As Vice President, he got our troops out of Iraq, pushed Obamacare through congress, helped negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal, and was instrumental in various budget negotiations. He has deep relationships on Capitol Hill and the experience to get his proposals passed. He will add a public option, which will help put us on the path to a single payer system, which I support as the eventual goal. He will make the United States a global leader on climate change, creating thousands of new jobs. He will push for justice on issues from race to LGBT rights and more. He will appoint judges who understand that the constitution guarantees our rights, including the right for women to make their own decisions about their bodies. 

Furthermore, I would also posit that, in such uniquely challenging times in the world, now more than ever we need to elect a candidate who knows how to restore our standing in the world, and also that as the president has a particularly large amount of control over foreign policy that this issue is especially critical in the presidential race, as opposed to congressional races, which are less important for foreign policy. Take health care. Let’s say that you support enacting medicare for all immediately. electing a president who supports that does not ensure that that would get passed by congress, while electing a president who supports a public option instead does not ensure that negotiations with congress won’t result in medicare for all instead. The president has the power to sign and veto legislation, urge congress, and push for their positions. On foreign policy, though, electing a president who, let’s say, opposes making human rights a focus of U.S.-China relations almost certainly assures that they won’t be, while electing a president who supports that almost certainly assues that they will be. 

Also, it’s what people do when they think that no one is watching that provides the best view of their true nature. Biden’s true nature shows that he cares about people more than pretty much any politician. Here’s an example of what he does when he thinks that nobody is watching. From the very beginning of his political career, every time he ran for anything, this woman in Delaware would send him a $25 check. Not that long ago, she died. Joe was reading the newspaper and saw her name in the obituaries section. He had never met her, but he felt compelled to pay his respects. He went for a shiva call (Jewish mourning practice). There were no cameras, this was not a public relations stunt, and Joe never mentioned it. The story was brought to light by her family. 

Finally, Biden understands that America has rarely, if ever, lived up to anything anywhere near the lofty ideals that we hold, but he understands that there was a sense of pride and unity, optimism and determination, and idealism that has been lost. He wants to restore that, but as an inclusive vision that actually lives up to our aspirations and leaves no one behind. This is quite possibly our last chance to recapture that knowledge of what America can be, that vision of what our destiny can be, that was advanced by such figures as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Frank Church, and Walter Mondale. Restoring that vision in the next few years could ensure it’s survival, while I fear that failing to bring that vision back now will mean that it could be gone forever. No one else running focuses on much beyond their individual policies. Many say they can unite us, but no one provides the unifying vision that we had, that we need. This is what makes America special. This vision is Joe Biden’s vision
(From his website)-Joe’s Vision:

“We are in a battle for the soul of America. It’s time to remember who we are. We’re Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.”

Joe also states on his website, “Our best days still lie ahead.” Let’s elect someone with the experience, tenacity, and vision to make this statement a reality. It’s not yet too late. If we work together, we can do it."

12582,"25, white dude from Atlanta. My first ever vote was for Obama. I was so excited about it. Felt that same excitement when I early voted on Monday for Joe. Name a more iconic duo."
12583,"I don’t think so. I’m from Ohio and I’m no fan of DeWine but there’s been people screaming about the potential risks to voters.

He’s been taking things pretty seriously from what I can tell and he didn’t look happy at all to announce that during his press conference today. They’ve been debating it for weeks.

Plus they’re still allowing absentee ballot requests. I planned to vote tomorrow and I probably will request an absentee ballot. 

If anything it’ll actually help some turnout I think since people won’t be afraid to go out."
12584,"Glad to hear it. I'm in basically the same boat (TBH, I didn't hear a lot about bernie in 2016 and was happy enough to vote for Hillary. I disagree with her about some things but she's a fine statesman and the conspiracy theories are horseshit).

Been very frustrating to see a certain segment I can only call the ""edgy left"" eager to pull defeat from the jaws of victory, celebrating and defending non-voting or saying Biden is actually worse than trump etc. 

Of course, though those people yell loudest and usually get the most retweets because sensationalism spreads, I'm sure most bernie supporters are reasonable people and will vote for Joe.

12586,"1. Caregivers are definitely underpaid, but the unfortunate part of it is that when we increase wages and education requirements for workers for higher-quality daycare, you have a situation like mine, where daycare is 2k a month for one child. (This is also partially due to lower caregiver ratios at younger ages, and pre-k helps to balance out the costs; since we have universal pre-k, more facilities have been struggling and needed to raise prices). That's high enough that all middle-class people would struggle to afford that. 

2. It's part of an economic issue as well. If only people could easily afford to have kids (assuming childcare workers are being paid fairly), basically only upper-class people would be able to afford it. And that's not enough to fund social security. High-quality childcare can also benefit society as a whole with healthier workers. We need to see childcare as an investment the same way we see k-12 schooling. 

3. Back to 1, childcare workers are part of working families, and if we pay them the way they should be (and we should), it's not going to be all that affordable when the ratios are low at a young age. So we either subsidize it, change family leave policies so that for the first year or two of a child's life (when the caregiver ratio is the lowest and results in the most expensive daycare), parents are able to split leave so someone is at home with the baby at all times, or we create a loan program similar to college loans. After all, parents can save up for years for college in a 529 plan, and daycare is more expensive than in-state tuition in some areas. However, since fertility is age-limited, we can't expect families to save up over years and accumulate wealth. 


I don't think having a stay-at-home parent is the solution for many families financially. Given that the parent is not able to save for retirement and is missing out on earnings, in the case of divorce (or permanent disability/death of the breadwinner), it puts them at risk. And for parents that require licensure in their field, it could put them in a difficult position for maintaining it (depending on the field)."

12599,Welcome!
12600,"I think I did. Biden took a little bit of money from his supporters and won with it in some really important rust belt states. I trust him to win again if I donate more money to him.

For Bernie, it's a pretty bad idea to have family on your payroll. It could look like laundering campaign funds even if that's not what he's doing."
12601,Yes!
12602,I think he said no fracking on Federal Lands?
12603,It's wild to me that this sub exists.  I honestly can't imagine *wanting* to vote for a man like Biden.  We live in stupid times.
12604,A status quo moderate preceded Trump. Why wouldn't the next status quo moderate lead to the same outcome? If Biden is elected I expect Obama's 3rd term and a Trump clone to follow in 2024.

12606,"**Detroit, MI: Get Out the Vote Event with Joe Biden**

&gt;California Sen. Kamala Harris will campaign in Michigan for Joe Biden on Monday, appearing with him at a 7 p.m. rally at Renaissance High School.

&gt;The event is open to the public, and people are being asked to **[RSVP here.](https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/event/259596/)**"
12607,"Howdy!

Greetings from Team Pete!

Glad to take the first seat!"
12608,"$15 minimum wage, a path towards Universal Healthcare, a solid climate plan, etc. + Generally being more liberal than Hillary or Obama"
12609,"“After meeting with carpenters in Pennsylvania and dock workers here in Michigan and dairy farmers in Wisconsin, I came up with a plan,” she said. “We are going to build a beautiful blue wall of Democratic votes around the Midwest, and we are going to make Donald Trump pay for it.”"
12610,Funny thing about all the nastier Sanders supporters hoping something disqualifies Biden before convention is that it’s more likely Biden’s delegates switch to Pete than Sanders getting to win by default.
12611,"It's because some people prefer overall platform that Joe brings. That being said, when more Bernie supporters join us, they can help push Joe to adopt some of the issues that perhaps we can all move together with."
12612,"Don't sell them, just be there if they're upset. Talk about something else, if they want to talk politics they'll bring it up themselves. I only ever talk about what I like or what I'm doing, I never want to tell someone what they should be doing or challenging things they believe in good faith because someone probably led them to believe those things in bad faith if they're untrue.

In general if you are in disagreement with someone over anything, bring it up a higher level to where you can agree. Keep going up to a higher big picture level if you're still in disagreement. Highest level could be something like ""well can we agree that people want to be happy."" Once you've agreed on something, you can find other things you agree about and you'll both start to see that what we agree on far outweighs the things that divide us."
12613,"I know what you mean, every time Biden starts talking it's like we're going on a verbal adventure, but sometimes the destination is really nice!"
12614,"I'm honestly on board with anything Biden wants to do to absorb and adapt the Amy-Beto-Pete Avengers team in any way shape or form

please joe, take the policies, take all the policies, become the policy czar"
12615,I'm sure she's in total isolation.
12616,"I don’t even really mind his lack of qualifications, it’s more his policy and behavior that mind. I’d be fine with Pete or Yang being president even though they lack the resume. 

I want trump to pull through Covid-19 with good policy but I want him to stumble a bit in terms of his speeches and behavior."
12617,Wow. That was puts it all out there much more efficiently than anything I could have said.
12618,"Yeah he seems as lively as ever.  It's not an easy job campaigning and it will be even harder when he gets the job but all indications I've seen show that he's up for it.  He's also had a lifetime of rubbing elbows with a lot of smart people, I hope he knows who to tap for what and they can do a better job than what we have now, which is a pirate crew of an administration."
12619,Oh yes they did. If you were still with Trump after the Mexican Rapists speech you knew damn well what he was about.
12620,"And we don't expect any real change under Biden.  I'll vote for him if he is the nominee, because the alternative Party is an outright criminal organization, embodied by their flag bearer.  

Biden talks about a big tent when he needs votes.  We will see how big that tent really is when progressives ask him to go beyond just cleaning up Trump's mess."
12621,I wonder if the media should start covering Joe as if he's the president already and ditch the coverage of the current occupant.
12622,She was really the beginning of the malarkey.

12624,No
12625,Lmao
12626,"So fucking what? Lots of politicians get paid for making speeches. I guess we should never vote for any of them, those lousy no-good thugs."
12627,"Just remember south florida is more then Miami. Theres also Broward, Palm, and Monroe counties. Cubans are influential in Miami but once you get out of Miami and into other cities in Dade or up into Broward and Palm counties the demos shift. I know you didnt mean to imply all latinos in florida were cuban. I just want to point oit how damaging the socialist thing is here because we have so many south americans who have had problems with socialists. Socialisim is a hard sell to the Venezuelan bakery I go to, and its a hard sell to my Colombian neighbors. Even south american countries that arent socialist like Colombia have problems with communist guerilla groups like Farc. And the castro remarks... not helping Bernie. 

I had read an article that said Biden was tailoring his latino outreach to each community were Bernie was going to use the same approach he did in Texas and California and I thought to myself...treating Caribbean and South Americans like Mexicans isn't going to work out well for him.  We have different issues. And not every Latino here cares about mexicans, I'm ashamed that some in our community are republicans who actually support the border wall and deportations. They got their citizenship and dont care for anyone else. It infuriates me."
12628,Welcome! California is going to be critical.
12629,"Experience and empathy. Biden will be a much better actor working with Congress, who we need to pass the legislation we all want."
12630,"not a terrible sample size as long it's spread out / random enough. and not just going to one retirement home, for example."
12631,"Not to mention, he has a MAJORITY of votes right now, a first in this primary season, so there's really no disputing it. GO JOE!"
12632,On C-Span and ditto
12633,"&gt; Yeah, M4A is definitely a wedge issue here. Personally, I don't like M4A because there are a lot of people (like myself) who are middle class but because of the specifics of how my benefits were done would make less after taxes and not get as much benefit under Sanders' plans.

That's wonderful for you, but millions are uninsured. Including my girlfriend, a 22 year old grad student with no way to pay for insurance. If she got seriously ill today with cancer or something, she would be in debt for **life**"
12634,"I'm watching, and it's a great speech so far. I'm coming from Team Pete, and Joe doesn't make me as calm as Pete did when he speaks, but Joe is growing on me. I'll happily vote for him in November. After last night's address from 45 and so many cancellations, postponements, etc today... at least Joe's speech is a bit of relief.

This is the president we NEED in the White House."
12635,Because they would ban him.
12636,"&gt;I’ll take a few more years of the status quo pre-Trump if that’s what we are getting

I don't feel like that's what on offer here. Biden would be a very progressive leader, lowering the cost of healthcare, record investments in agriculture and renewables, a greater minimum wage and free community college.

I just don't get why this is considered status quo. To me that's brilliant and doable."
12637,As a Floridian I will do everything I can to make Florida blue again 🥺
12638,I can’t wait for Biden Son vs Trump Kids
12639,"That does make sense it's just hard to figure out how where ""the other Biden"" came from. But perhaps I am just looking into it too much."
12640,"And Biden is a symptom of the disease, known for taking billionaire money and protecting their interests, as evidenced by his voting record. I see a lot of contempt on this sub for die-hard Bernie supporters and it will definitely encourage me to not show up to vote for Biden vs Trump. Along with Biden's career and the policies he has espoused.

This is from a former YangGang member, now Bernie supporter by the way."
12641,"2016 was frankly a different year. Nobody thought Trump had a chance and Bernie did actually end up getting the party to move left, which would have been more difficult had he dropped out early.

This year is a lot different. I know Bernie recognizes the stakes and the primary isn’t really as close as it was last time. I can’t completely blame him for wanting to have a one-on-one debate, but I expect him to drop on Wednesday unless he has a remarkable performance in the next set of primaries."
12642,"See I like Castro as an administration pick for that same reason, but for something more directly influential in immigration reform. He's one of those guys I think should be given his pet subject and basically told ""have fun, it's all yours."""
12643,Hopefully this is right!
12644,"Welcome aboard, friend."

12647,"Your past choices don't define you, welcome!!!"
12648,Agreed Abrams would be my top pick aswell.
12649,"Yeah,  quite a few of the posts are becoming repetitive. Now that Bernie isn’t much of a threat, it’s time to focus on helping Joe win in November."
12650,It was a shtick on /r/pete_buttigieg as well.
12651,"I’m wondering, while not trying to be disrespectful, how Bernie could even be considered slightly ”liberal” in any way? You even used the term ”ultra liberal” to describe your granddad. Liberalism means and has always meant a small state, and if Bernie had is way, the state would be bigger than ever. I’m trying to understand your reasoning behind the use of the term ”liberal” which is often thrown around, even in s derogatory way. Thanks in advance."
12652,Joe can't even speak in complete sentences.
12653,"If he literally had less than a 1% chance of beating Trump?  Yes.


Bernie does not have a path to victory, and symbolically staying in until Wednesday (hopefully he gets the hint after Florida) does not make any difference."
12654,"Trump is not like them in the least, if they payed attention they would see he is their opposite. 

Joe is an eloquent speaker when he has had the time to plan and practice. 

Joe and Trump couldn’t be more different one is an intelligent, accomplished person and former VP. 

The other is essentially a con man pandering to the lowest common denominator."
12655,"&gt;Are you saying people aren’t allowed to adjust their viewpoints and grow?

Saying that progressives would use it against the ticket"
12656,"People squabble because X candidate is taking away votes from Y candidate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The system fools you into thinking the candidates are to blame when it's the system that's stacked against you. We need ""First Past the Post"" and we need it yesterday."
12657,Somehow I doubt Trump tweets this one.
12658,We need their votes and their support. It would be a terrible strategy to alienate them and it would a terrible thing for them to create a third party. Completely disagree.
12659,"It’s not really over until he gets 1,991 delegates. We all know who the nominee is, but acting with humility and and letting the race drag out for the next few weeks won’t change who wins the nomination, but will win us many votes that we need in the general."
12660,"I'm not voting and I work from home, so I haven't been outside in over a month. My dad was trying to get us all to go to vote in the primaries and I had to help my mom convince him that it wasn't worth it. I'm telling them to vote by mail in the general or at least vote early to avoid a crowd."
12661,Fair.
12662,This team work makes me feel so good. We truly are a United party dedicated to getting trump out of the WH!
12663,no
12664,"Rules of the road. No need to insult Bernie personally or his supporters. That being said, I personally believe his action to stay in a race he has all but lost to be reckless. People will have to go to the polls in such an environment and it is not okay, especially for a race that is done."
12665,Fair enough.  Still should have done earlier. Hopefully Sanders realizes based on the math and the national interest it has no effect.
12666,"Oh yeah? Well why hasn't Biden made a video in the past 10 minutes? Can't explain that one, how curious 🤔 Did he die? Seems like the only logical conclusion."
12667,"Remember that, regardless of the results, stick to the ROTR. While it may feel good if we steamroll every single state today, rubbing it in will harm the coalition that's being built, rather than help grow it."
12668,"/r/JoeBiden does not feature links to that website. Please do not submit links from unreliable or extremely biased sources.

12669,What a brave thing to say
12670,"What's up. I'm also a 19 year old white dude from the Midwest. I'm not a socialist, and never have been, but I think we have a pretty common identity.

First off, I'm very sorry to hear about your sister. That kind of stuff runs deep and it's hard to put someone in charge of dealing with those cases. You need a lot of trust. A big part of Joe Biden's plan is the decriminalization of marijuana. While he has for the moment not fully come out in favor of it's full legalization, many of the former candidates have a lot of leverage in his campaign now that they've started campaigning for him. I think it's likely that he will eventually come out with the legalization of marijuana, much like he had a big role as the person who persuaded the president to legalize gay marriage in 2015. I can guarantee he will continue the work Obama did to keep drug users out of prisons and into rehabilitation.

Biden isn't for medicare for all, and neither am I. I will remind you that it took Obama's entire first term to get the ACA passed in a democratic congress, and even that was a deeply flawed version of it because of concessions they had to make with Republicans and conservative democrats alike. However great you think M4A is, it will not be possible to pass it in the next 10 years. Even if it were to get to the president's desk, it would likely be unrecognizable from the legislation you want. That's how politics have always worked, and that will not change with Bernie as president, or Biden. Compromise has to be made, and sometimes when Republicans have the power, concessions are necessary to keep our goals in sight.

Biden supports a public option, which is what most countries have in some form or another. It doesn't abolish private insurance, but it does allow you to be put on a government plan, or buy into Medicaid. I have to be honest, my private healthcare is quite good, so I'm not too up to date with how the two compare. What I can tell you is that one is far cheaper, far more marketable to the American public, and more likely to pass.

On climate, Bernie has a $14 trillion plan. Biden's is a bit less than $2 trillion, with a key difference: nuclear energy. Most experts agree that nuclear is by far the most efficient way to switch to renewable energy in the long term. For some reason, Bernie is very much against nuclear energy. While the Biden plan spends much less, it's because it relies on the foundations we already have in renewables, and builds upon them rather than trying to chart out a different path with unnecessary handicaps. Regardless, Biden's plan was made with the help of experts in the field, as well as economists who know what needs to be done. This is a common theme in the Biden campaign, because Joe knows he isn't perfect. Not all of his policies will fit all the problems we face in the future. He's willing to rely on the experts. That's one takeaway from this week's debate which made a lot of people more comfortable with Biden's handling of emergency situations.

If you are a progressive, the choice is very obviously Biden. He isn't the perfect candidate, he's actually my third choice. But he has the best shot of getting work done in office to move America towards the goals you want. And keeping Trump for a second term will *exclusively* hurt all the causes you seek to get action on."
12671,Have the bros started losing their minds yet?
12672,Incredibly. I didn't hear him so much as stutter. This speech really blows a hole through the whole cognitive decline rhetoric over on S4P.

12679,That's bullshit and you know it. Sorry the media actually reports on your candidate instead of treating them like the sun shines out of their asshole like you do.
12680,"None of that is rigging, good lord y'all get insufferable"
12681,"NTY refuses to update their polls. They still have Bernie winning at over 10%, despite it saying ""Update March 6th"""
12682,"What I never see discussed on this issue is that the cost of childcare is mainly the cost of the caregivers being able to pay rent, buy groceries, etc.

HHS recommends no more than 5 kids for every 1 trained adult at the 2-3 age range. Well, some back of the envelop math tells us we should expect that it'll cost a parent 20% of their paycheck to get that childcare (actually more, because of all the overhead expenses in addition to the caregiver's pay).

So, if the cost of childcare is too high, we really have to ask what we think this problem represents:

(1) Are caregivers overpaid? (Unlikely)

(2) Is it the public's responsibility to subsidize your family decisions? (I don't like this approach)

(3) Are working families underpaid? (Ding ding ding. Rebuild the middle class so folks can afford stuff like this. Or afford to have a single income family with a stay at home parent.)"

12687,"Um what? Lol

EDIT: Sorry not to come across as belittling just find it funny to consider Biden a Republican as his platform is left of Hillary Clinton’s in 2016 and that was before recent changes have pushed it further left."
12688,Malarkey recovery is a long process. I hope you make your way through it
12689,"Hey! Fellow Bernie supporter here and Biden Lurker... I was checking this out and found most of his policies here. https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/joe-biden/ Hope that helps. I agree I am not really excited for most of his stances he does have a lot of Bernie's view points albeit not as ""revolutionary"" as Bernie they both have a lot in common. My stance on this is either Biden or Bernie we both progress our agenda just a matter of how fast and hard we press it.   
P.S. Wish he had federalizing marijuana on his policy instead of letting states decide my state is taking forever here in NY :/"
12690,"This is such a good point. We heard this so much last night from Bernie-leaning pundits that the ""establishment has rallied behind Joe Biden."" No, PEOPLE have rallied behind Joe Biden."

12692,"&gt; Moderate Wing 

You mean the majority. I hate to break it to you but the Democratic Party is a majority center-left party. There’s a reason most of the midterm wins in 2018 were center-left Dems and not far left Dems. 

&gt; This continues to be ignored, and it will continue to lose elections until the Democrats want to learn.

I think what continues to be ignored is the reality is that the minority far left wing of the party is more concerned about making a statement than actually making a change in government. You can’t make any changes without actually winning all three branches of government. Hence why I am more than willing to vote for either Biden or Sanders come November. You sit at home or vote Trump in November, all you’re doing is throwing a tantrum and swinging the Supreme Court into a 7-2 majority and continuing Trump executive policies. Notice how letting Trump take charge has given the far left wing absolutely nothing? Form a coalition with the center left Dems and maybe you’ll get the changes you want, but we actually have to win first."
12693,"Honestly, if someone likes Bernie's policies they should be voting for Biden. Not because Biden's policies perfectly align with Bernie but because they don't. It is extremely rare for a great leap to the left to take place, and trying it would probably result in a backlash.

Someone like Biden who is left of center but not super far left could probably pull national politics further left as President than someone like Bernie. ""Incrementalism"" is a dirty word in some circles but it is the method that actually works for progress."
12694,Probably the only way it can be liberated is if Joe Biden wins in November.
12695,Wait people said Elizabeth freaking Warren didn’t have policies? How do you say “these people are high” in ROTR?
12696,I feel like Bernie would love an hour of debating himself.
12697,A good thing for Democrats in general.
12698,"I’ve been a Biden supporter from day one. I’ve seen countless people on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook hurl disgusting attacks at Biden, ranging from “he’s demented” to “he’s a creep” to “he’s a Republican.”

Today is the first time in a while where I’m truly optimistic that Biden will win this primary and metaphorically tell all those who attacked him to shove it.

12699,They're getting scared of Diamond Joe!
12700,"Depends on what you define as ""better.""

If you want single payer health care, Bernie is better for that. If you think single payer health care is a horrible idea, Biden is better."
12701,"oh no, I don't think my love of Biden can override my hatred of Chuck Todd."
12702,I'm gonna need Glen Beck to pull out the conspiracy board again to keep up with that nonsense.
12703,Why is Pence on there? Are those people betting on Trump dying?
12704,"Look at other polls on 538:

**- Arizona -**

(Mar 4)

Biden 46%

Sanders 17%

&amp;#x200B;

**- Florida -**

(Mar 10)

Biden 66%

Sanders 22%

**- Ohio -**

(Jan 21)

Biden 32%

Sanders 21%

\------

&amp;#x200B;

Dates are when polls were conducted; it's very obvious Sanders is going to get murdered real hard. Why Bernie doesn't want to drop out now, is probably because he wants to debate Biden in a final hurrah this Sunday.

But Bernie not dropping out now means he's not dropping out with his head high; he's continuing to take money from his supporters to fuel their delusion that he's going to be the nominee.

Unlike Andrew Yang, who saw the writing on the wall and dropped out because Yang has character and did not want to continue to take money from supporters, when he knew that he was not going to win.

This is going to forever bite Bernie and his movement.

12705,"There's a reason why 538 has Bernie with less than a 1 in 100 chance of winning the nomination and why Nate Silver has started working on general election models. It's because Bernie has to win every state from here on out by a margin that's next to impossible. That's why I said that Biden is running against Trump at this point.

I didn't imply anything about which votes counted in primaries we haven't had yet because of course the primary is still ongoing. I was remarking on the feasibility of a Biden win versus a Sanders win."
12706,"How about the folks on /r/SandersForPresident massively upvoting a post that deliberately takes a Biden quote out of context to make him sound deranged. The actual video isn’t nearly as bad as it’s made to seem.

Be aware, all, this will keep happening, so let’s keep a level head on the facts. It’s blatant internet misinformation."
12707,"Fascinating threads about her. Something does NOT add up.

https://twitter.com/fliedgaff/status/1243613797769592832?s=21"
12708,"There's also lots of Bernie supporters who aren't Democrats. They like the man's policies, but aren't beholden to the Democratic party if he's not nominated"
12709,"Amazing how Hillary's warnings are always spot-on, even in 2020."
12710,I'm looking for the Hispanic data
12711,This is so wholesome. &lt;3
12712,Hmmmm... test run for VP?
12713," Tammy Duckworth was indeed born in Thailand but is still a natural born citizen because her father was a U.S. Citizen. Therefore, she can certainly attain the Presidency should the need arise."
12714,And they say that Joe is the one senile?
12715,"I originally wasn't, mainly since I had seen the report of super-super-super low turnout in Chicago early on, and was thinking we'd get another North Dakota or two, but apparently it's looking like that's not holding up across the board (or across time). So, yeah, it's looking like it's still very likely a sweep. Definitely not expecting Sanders to be &lt;15% in Florida like some people are hoping for, though. Maybe some districts though?"
12716,"&gt; He's wanted. Maybe not by you

And not by the voters."
12717,"No. She's literally a member of United States Armed Forces. She was engaged in combat. That means she was willing to give up her life for this country. While running she had the very same purpose in mind - defending USA, although as opposed to her military career this time the threat is internal. I don't know why people have adopted such a negative attitude towards Tulsi Gabbard. I am very grateful that she had endorsed Joe. Without a doubt Bernie's endorsement will follow as soon as he drops out, he had shown in 2016 he is a man of integrity and puts country's best interest before his ego. While Trump does not have the entire GOP behind him (i recommend watching the hilarious compilations of GOP politicians being asked whether they're going to support him and their collective ""i have no idea"" answer), he most certainly has the majority of it, and he has a benefit of being incumbent this time. Let's unite to take him down, there is no other way."
12718,"The truth is they want Biden to lose.

If Biden wins, some feel that will ""hold back"" their movement.

They were never on our side and are showing it to be true now."
12719,You should say either/or

Feel the love"
12721,"I'm not saying Amy has no pull in midwest states, but both her support and Joe's both skew hard for much older voters. They just overlap too much, I think, so I don't see how she brings that much to the table, beyond being from the midwest. There's other midwest choices one could make. It's true that she's been vetted already, but I would say that the vetting revealed some skeletons that could be problematic. She can reliably deliver MN for Biden, but... it's already likely blue. If she could bring WI or MI or PA, that would be another story.

I think you need to go with charisma even if it contrasts starkly with Joe. His biggest issue will be getting people excited enough to come out and vote."
12722,7.3 pts now 😉
12723,"I certainly don't believe that all Sanders supporters are trolls. But Sanders is a populist that uses emotional rhetoric and is very eager to point his finger at who to blame, so it's not surprising to me that a disproportionate amount of his supporters have harmful online presences."
12724,Welcome aboard! Let's beat Donald Trump.
12725,Welcome!!
12726,"Not a surprise since that is Bloomberg's PAC. As a gun owner, still not something I wanted to see especially since Biden has been courting ""Hell Yes"" Beto."
12727,"Good image, but you should have put Pete on it."
12728,You should look around the sub. The question has been asked alot lately and there have been lots of quality replies
12729,"That’s kind of my worry. If turn out is low, it’s far more likely to be low for Joe due to his voting demographics.

Also, Bernie opened up five more offices in PA.. it doesn’t look like he’s planning to drop out anytime soon."
12730,"Why is Bernie acting like the 1.5 trillion from the fed was free money?  For all intents and purposes to the country, it’s Monopoly money.  It’s meaningless.  It wasn’t money created that could have gone elsewhere."
12731,"I remember 2016 when a lot of people were saying that there wasn't really a difference between Clinton and Trump and then didn't vote. I don't think as many people will make that mistake again. 

Also, twitter is garbage. I use it too, but just remember that it is flooded with rabid fanbases and does not represent the average person."
12732,"Going by that logic, isn’t a country investing in the wellbeing of its citizens another thing that can ultimately produce more profit than cost?

Why is the stock market treated with this holistic mindset, but giving doctors the supplies they need is just treated as a cost when inaction is clearly more expensive?"
12733,"Yeah, I'm pretty smart and likeable and I back Biden, and so should you. And that's no malarkey. 😎"
12734,"suck your dad off Joe's hoe, your shitty candidate is about to get us Trump for another 4 years"
12735,Baldwin is selected?
12736,And now he's let go of his ambitions and allowed Biden to lead. Just because he wasn't a lifelong Democrat doesn't mean he doesn't care.
12737,Why didn’t it cross your mind? Bernie is only a Democrat when it suits him to try and get what he wants. He isn’t a uniter and mentioned the “establishment” a few times too many. Can’t bash and alienate the very people with the power to vote you in then act surprised when they decide they are unwilling to support you.
12738,"She effectively did endorse him in a recent interview, without using the word endorse."
12739,"Morning Joe Monday guest list:

12740,"Nah pledged delegates don’t have to vote for who they’re pledged to, though they all will vote for Pete first ballot if he doesn’t endorse Biden."
12741,Definitely NC
12742,Cratered in the debates? She did well in all the debates and in one of them she dominated everyone. Her time as AG is only controversial if you take a handful of cherry picked examples out of context and believe the far left/far right narrative of them.
12743,"First of all, I've been treated well by a number Sanders supporters and many of my friends are Sanders supporters, so it's important to not paint with too wide of a brush. But yes, we need to treat them well. Obviously it's the politically correct thing to do in order to unite the party, but it's also the right thing to do as a respectful human being."
12744,I wonder if we'll ever manage to get ranked choice voting in this country. I'd be totally fine making my ticket Bernie first Biden second or something.
12745,"A NYT analysis I think I read today said Sanders would need to win 70 percent of the remaining delegates. 

Or put another way. Sanders would need to win every state left with at least a 20 percent lead in each state."
12746,You're gosh darn right I'm enthusiastic about the man who's gonna be the most progressive American president ever
12747,"I didn't have any other place to put this, but today I realized that this is the first election where I'm not technically a ""young voter"" and it has my slightly shook. Either way, GO JOE!

- Aging Millennial"
12748,"&gt;Perhaps a further hint: They kept up the Amy and Kamala shirt.

Are we gonna get two vice presidents?"
12749,"Real question what's the best strategy for that with Citizens United being a thing? I mean obviously we could say ""constitutional amendment"" but we all know that's not politically possible right now, so it has to be something that can be done with Congress, and something that will be upheld by the current court."
12750,"Well, they won't even vote for their own candidate, so I doubt we'll see any of that change for the November elections."
12751,"The ripple effects are going to last for much longer. This is an economic disaster, and it's exposed the Trump and his administration as the incompetent frauds that they are. The only ""accomplishment"" Trump could point to was the stock market, and that dissolved in a matter of days."
12752,"Yeah fuck that 12 year old! 

/s he and only he gets a pass"
12753,He's thinking about it. Don't get your hopes up just yet.
12754,Either of the Baldwins.
12755,"If anyone is interested on getting started calling states for Joe, Michigan is a great one to start with. Really positive people and you can get started in the next 10 minutes!

Let me know if anyone needs further details."
12756,"Yesterday we got 326 subscribers! Let's keep this JOEmentum going! So happy to see all the Pete supporters joining us, we love you!"
12757,Well said!
12758,"If Ben is on board, I expect Pete to endorse shortly."
12759,I canvass in mostly poor areas and I found that most people are smart and engaged.
12760,Why wouldn’t homeless people be covered under any universal plan? I think homeless people can get Medicaid even now.
12761,A King and a Prince.
12762,"I think they both can be right, just about different people"
12763,"My cousin tried to recruit me to the ""Justice Democrats"" in early 2016. He hasn't lived in the US in years, he lives with his girlfriend and daughter in Czech Republic. And it turns out he couldn't even vote in the primaries because he was a registered Republican ""because of a former job"" (??).

He came from a wealthy family in Westchester NY if that paints a better picture. So: privilege in the highest form and totally out of touch.

Honestly that is the chaos that follows Bernie&amp;Co. around, and it's just so hard to make sense of to most mainstream Democrats."
12764,"Agree. I like her, but she has baggage and has made several missteps. To be fair,  the media also is harsh on her (I still remember how hard she got dragged for SESTA despite every other candidate also voting for it, and how a couple of things from her time as AG were wildly distorted), and she has to deal with a lot of misogyny and low key racism. Plus, she's from a blue state. At the same time, a lot of her supporters expect it to be her and a lot of Joe's supporters are kind of for her at this point....

I honestly feel like Val Demings would be a better choice, or one of the Tammys (Baldwin would be a olive branch to the progressives) or Lujan-Grisham if we want to lean into the swing states (rust belt/sun belt/etc.). Lujan-Grisham would be mildly amusing, if you look at her record (she's for free public college...but she wants it paid for by fracking). Demings, though, can bring FL and is someone who is kind of ""accepted"" (or at least not hated) by the ideological spectrum unlike Klob (whom some on the left hate) or Warren (whom some centrists hate). 

 I suspect it will be a Black woman (the backlash will be intense if it's not) so my guess is Abrams, Harris, Bottoms, Sewell, and Demings. Moore would be a nice olive branch to progressives, but she looks older than her age (she is in her late 60s) as would Lee (I love her)....but she is just too old. And Harris....is the most experienced."
12765,Bloomberg and Biden can coordinate as long as they do it on live television.
12766,"This is why I changed my mind to pocket turtle

Pocket turtle is a registered democrat and has been for thirty years"
12767,Ayy lmao
12768,"I'm calling right now that Washington is going to be better for Joe than people think.

I think he wins it."
12769,"ADOPT MEDICARE FOR ALL

with that out of the way.... notably, joe's former boss and his compromise and failures is why i went full on progressive in the fist place. joe is getting my vote simply because the alternative will destroy the groundwork progressivism fights on. i think his commitment to warren's proposal is lip service. prove me wrong, ponyboy joe. i dare you."
12770,"Sanders need to drop the fuck out right now

Enough with this primary"
12771,A president can leave it up to the states. That's what Biden promises to do.
12772,"And hes very optimistic in some cases for Sanders. 
Sanders just has a huge advantage with caucuses cause Sanders supporters are usually college kids who can easily skip classes and spend 2 hours of their day. Working people who are more likely to support Biden dont have that time."
12773,What were the delegate totals before SC?
12774,What kind of choice is there in healthcare? Is there some amount of illness or injury you are ok with having? I'd rather not die of anything preventable just because I can't afford healthcare premiums from private insurance. We already see the failing in private health insurance with the cost of insulin.

12776,That debate was the one where she said “all lives matter.” The debate definitely effected the results of Michigan.

12778,"What results are these? The same shit weve had for decades? Keeping the status quo? Those aren't results. It helps no one. 

Joe has a history of bending over for repubs a d his declining mental ability will make him even more susceptible."
12779,I see you're familiar with Sanders supporters.
12780,"Welcome, I also voted Bernie in 2016 primary, and voted Hillary in election. I got little disappointed in Bernie because I felt he did not put his full weight after Hillary for whatever reason. Then I started looking into his policies this election and math just does not add up. Finally his base’s association with ANTIFA made me not to pick Bernie this election. Biden is the one who can unify party and bring neutrals against Trump, who must be defeated for the good of this country."
12781,We weren’t a slush fund already?
12782,"I just read an interview with Bernie:

&gt;Sanders did, however, pledge his support to Biden if he won the nomination. “We’ve got to do everything possible to defeat Trump. I’ll support Joe if he wins, he’ll support me if I win,” he said.

12785,"&gt; severe acute respiratory syndrome

I am surely not qualified to explain or talk about this but SARS means severe acute respiratory syndrome.

&gt;Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1) is the subtype of influenza A virus that was the most common cause of human influenza (flu) in 2009, and is associated with the 1918 outbreak known as the Spanish flu. It is an orthomyxovirus that contains the glycoproteins haemagglutinin and neuraminidase.

12786,"The Yang gang was a force in this primary. I was in awe of the unity and enthusiasm y'all showed on reddit and twitter.

I am so happy and relived to have you and the Yang Gang on the Team.

12787,"I think reducing Sen. Sanders' work to ""hosting musical guests"" is unfair and disingenuous."
12788,"Like, do the people sharing the edited clip *really* think that Joe Biden is saying he supports Trump?

What universe do they live in, where a single person would look at this and completely forget that Joe is actively running to replace Trump?"
12789,"Yes it does not matter to me either. And lots of endorsements hurt for this reason because it pisses people off who don't like the person. But if I were Conan, I would blame NBC. It's not like Jay Leno gives a crap about helping NBC, he was ready to retire at that point from what I remember. I'm sure they have done plenty of crappy things to a lot of people outside of Jay Leno's involvement."
12790,"I am in high school, and my school goes 18 months to 18 years, nobody is traumatized. I see it firsthand. Most people understand why we’re inside and are not scarred."
12791,Especially if you look at early voting vs. same day voting. Biden won pretty all of the people who voted after Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out pretty easily.
12792,They have to request it.  Obviously he thought he was okay until now.
12793,"I wouldn't call it pessimism. I'd call it vigilance. The tone of subs can change pretty quickly, especially as they grow and attract new members who aren't familiar with their culture.

Saw this with the Yang sub. When it was around 20k, it was mostly a lot of positive news and substantive policy discussions. Then when it got over 50k it became non-stop complaining about the media, the DNC, and the Bernie subs. ""Humanity First"" became ""Humanity First, but not for Berners.""

But, that type of thing isn't inevitable."

12803,"At first it was mayo Pete which I found funny. Then it was the rat comparisons, the CIA shills, etc. it went from a joke to “if you’re not Bernie and you want change you’re a Manchurian candidate” and ad hominems flung at their supporters.

It's the internet, though.  Stuff is gonna get blown up and there will be many, many angry keystrokes.

I get the frustration, anger and personal hurt many Bernie folks are going through.  I've been there, quite a few times.  We were gonna save the planet in 2000.  We were gonna stop a war in 2004.

12812,"You know what ""leave it up to the states"" means, right? It was used by racists to delay integration and by homophobes to delay gay marriage.

If Joe Biden was really progressive, he would support legalization, but instead, he calls marijuana a gateway drug and has supported the War on Drugs."

12817,"While I don’t disagree, CA, NY, and IL are pretty large parts of national GDP.

12819,"Some highlights

&gt;In a hypothetical matchup **last September**, Trump edged Biden 47% to 43%.

&gt;**Trump would beat Sanders**, an outspoken socialist, **by seven points** if the 2020 presidential election were held today.

&gt;**Biden is clearly seen as a more likable candidate than Sanders.** Forty-eight percent (48%) of all voters view Biden favorably, 48% unfavorably.
&gt;But just 38% have a favorable view of Sanders, while 60% regard him unfavorably. This includes 14% with a Very Favorable view and **42% with a Very Unfavorable** one."
12820,"LOL you know that only the top part of the bullet is the actual projectile right? A 9mm bullet is significantly larger than 5.56mm. Do.....do you actually think that the *case* is fired as well when a gun shoots?! Also you should look up how many firearm deaths in the US are from handguns and compare them to deaths from rifles. 

Liberal understanding of guns is such an embarrassment. At least learn the most basic facts about something before trying to legislate it. It's like a Republican trying to ban abortion when he doesn't even know where the uterus is. SO arrogant and out of touch...."
12821,"I watched his 1pm speech. It was very good. Bernie is not going anywhere in the next week. However I think based on his tone he is setting up Joe for a good debate. He basically outlined what he wants Joe to address - I think Bernie is giving Joe a chance to sell what Bernie is fighting for to his base. If Bernie does poorly next Tuesday I predict he will drop. I am not encouraging him to by any means, I just think he will. He is staying in the debate for the scheduled productive debate and for his base. I do not think Bernie will go harsh on Joe on Sunday. It will be friendly and about the issues.

You can already see many Bernie supporters joining Team Joe.  Bernie will bow out gracefully next Wednesday barring he does not pull off a landslide.  That is my prediction

And by the way, even though in this post I spoke with positive expectations of Bernie.  He is someone I am not a fan of.  I am and always have been since the beginning of the primary 100% Joe supporter

Thing is, for every guy like this, there are 1000 twitter accounts saying Biden has dementia, calling Warren a snake, calling Pete an establishment cia plant fake gay, and saying Biden supporters are *literally killing them* by not voting Bernie.

12831,Biden doesn’t support the gays though
12832,"Honestly, 48 hours ago I was team let-the-primaries-go-on. But things are so much different already than they were 48 hours ago.

At the end of the day, voting should be as accessible as possible to the most amount of people. If that can't happen, then it should be delayed. Not indefinitely but a few weeks to implement paper/mail-in ballots, drive up voting, contingency plans, etc. 

There's a way to do this well today, and forcing everyone to the polls today probably isn't one of them. Either way it's not a good look.

If this was a general election we'd be losing our shit. If the primary was close we'd be losing our shit.

Just because we're winning, lets not just view this through the lens of 'putting this to bed'."

I find it odd that folks were following another candidate for some time but only just recently (hours/days) created an account to post/reply here."
12836,This. The rest of the planet would welcome that very much. 🙂
12837,"Personally it made me feel a lot more comfortable with Biden in the general.

I thought his mind was going, but he seemed sharp enough tonight."
12838,Mostly Gen Z that are big into Bernie. Millennials are on the older end of the young people spectrum.

12841,Oh thank god this sub finally has a daily thread. That was the best part of the Pete subreddit and made is their were fewer low quality submissions. Having a place to discuss is great.
12842,"The polls consistent have Bernie beating Trump in more places, and by bigger margins. Biden can’t fill a high school gymnasium. He’s going to lose. I’ll bet you all thought Hillary was going to win in 16 too. Polls also favored Bernie then, too."
12843,"Yeah, that’s not what I’m getting. Your last sentence is dead on."
12844,"Right? I had ascribed to that belief that a Biden nomination would be a repeat of 2016. I don’t know how any Democrat could look at the turnout on Super Tuesday, regardless of who won or who you support, and not be inspired. Virginia doubled. Minnesota, North Carolina, Colorado, Texas. All had considerably higher turnout compared to 2016. When you see Steve Bullock in Montana suddenly decide to run for Senate after Biden surges, well I trust Bullock’s understanding of how to win in a state like that."
12845,"Governor is the only real option. You can't really go to another city and become mayor without some major pushback. 

He might have a shot at governor, but it's a really hard challenge, similar to Abrams in Georgia and Beto in Texas.

To be clear, I'm not really expecting or even necessarily hoping for VPete. But comments that he should hold a higher office first is completely ignoring the fact that it's extremely difficult to do so in Indiana."
12846,"yeah, our idiot Repub gov in TN who got elected on the strength of being a business guy who knows nothing about governing, like somebody else I know, has not shut squat down yet. :( If I wasn't in Nashville, where the mayor has enough functioning brain cells and foresight to do what needs to be done and order safer in place, I'd still be a free range hellcat."
12847,"Anyone who is a kid, a tween, or a young teenager under 16 who honestly says, ""I'll never vote for Biden."" tells the truth. I can go along with that fact, knowing that they will have to be 18 years of age to vote and Joe may not be around by the time they turn 18 and become a registered voter."
12848,"Sanders refuses to make inroads in the south and with black voters.  Sanders canceled an event in MS last week.  If you want to win the Democratic Primary you need to win southern states and have black people come out and vote for you.  This is why Biden will win and Sanders will lose. 

When Sanders does eventually throw in the towel, there is a place here for you and we welcome your help and support."
12849,"I hear you saying ""that the world is not divided into good people and bad people; that all of us are capable of good and bad things. Today, more than ever, politics matters, because leaders can call out either what is best in us or what is worst in us, can draw us either to our better or to our worst selves. Politics at its worst is ugly, but at its best politics can lift us up. It is not just policy making; it is moral. It is soul craft."""
12850,"At the very least, having Biden on the top of the ballot gives Doug Jones a shot.  Still going to be hard to hold the seat, but even if he loses, he’ll be able to bleed the Republican Senatorial Committee of money that could have been used in other races.


If Bernie was on the ballot, Mitch McConnell could literally just ignore Doug Jones completely.  Now more GOP dollars in Alabama is less GOP dollars in Arizona, Maine, North Carolina."
12851,"Is giving a shit about people a big factor for you?

What are your thoughts on Bernie Sanders having marched with MLK Jr. while Biden was pushing for race segregation?

Genuinely curious. I have a feeling i'll be banned just for commenting something that isn't pro-biden but, im curious."
12852,What's with the random comments being downvoted under threshold throughout the sub even though they're seemingly ok?
12853,"I made calls for an hour.  Left a bunch of messages.  Talked to 4 Biden, 1 Amy, 1 undecided (which was exciting), 2 Bernie."
12854,Nope.
12855,"Honest question: You voluntarily sought out and agreed to the terms of a loan. Do you believe you should now be released from the contractual responsibility to pay back the money you borrowed?

Not trying to trap you; I'm sincerely curious."
12856,BIG CHIN ENERGY
12857,Joe owes him a cabinet position tbh
12858,Seeing Joe flat out lie about his record on social security was pretty useful to me. Showed exactly who he is.
12859,"The reality is, had Pete been what they seem to want him to be (Wait, aren’t we supposed to be the ones who want people to be themselves???  Hmmm), he would never have gotten as far as he did, would never have influenced as many people as he did, and would absolutely never have had a ghost of a chance to become President.

There’s more to the presidency than vision and ideas.  You also have to be able to take steps toward that vision incrementally and in a way that brings others to support your direction.  You can’t be moving at 100mph while the American people are only willing to go 40.  They’ll jump off your train in a hurry and you’ll have zero chance to do anything.  It’s about expressing your ideas in terms people can understand, getting support before making a move, building alliances, and negotiating with opponents."
12860,Yea healthcare is really fucking complicated and so much is at risk which is why it’s so hard to change in this country and why the ACA was so hard to pass. At the end of the day everyone who has a shred of humanity needs to vote blue no matter who the presidential candidate from the democrats is!
12861,"Thank you, Senator Sinema!!"
12862,"Money isn't money. If I take a million dollars from a medical device corporation, don't you think that might effect how I feel about them price gouging life saving devices? I don't care who's running, it's who writes the check who has the power, I'll take Biden over Trump but he's definitely corrupt as well."
12863,Good. He's ignoring Bernie.
12864,"Betoforever   

Beto will work his as$ off 12-14 hours a day and do a spectacular job no matter what he is doing. I am still seething about he was treated so I can't even."
12865,u/reddit-tradeit needs to read this.
12866,"South Carolina won’t be going blue. 

However, I think deep red Utah might be flirting with the idea."
12867,Obama was one of the top 5 presidents of all time. It's a tetijr to the progress he was making
12868,"I think every state should go to vote by mail. I have voted in every single local election since registering in my county. As passionate as I am about voting,due to work, I probably would not have made it a point to get to the polls for things like school Levy's without vote by mail. It's such a better way to vote especially for elderly who don't drive, rural voters, college students, people without cars, and people whose work interferes with getting to the polls. If you are worried about security you can drop off your ballot at the courthouse or other polling centers."
12869,"Can someone gimme like a 2-3 sentence explanation why you're excited about Biden?
  
I'm assuming most of you are young, but I may be wrong. 
  
Legitimately curious.
  
Edit: Thanks for the downvotes, that was expected I guess... But also thanks for the real responses too"
12870,"I was planning to vote for Pete for as long as he stayed in the race. By the time he actually did drop though, I had already determined Biden would be next in line. I was very happy to see Pete endorse Biden the next day"
12871,Really? Last time I checked large numbers of black voters weren't falling for the *socialist* thing. They seem fine with capitalism
12872,It’s entertaining
12873,"We're in a similar situation. I have a 3 year old and my wife is pregnant. A week and a half ago I started getting some cold like symptoms, then last Sunday night had a fever of 100. Haven't had a fever since and didn't get tested but doing better and the cold symptoms are mostly gone. But have been staying inside pretty well."
12874,"First we win Alabama in the primaries, next Joe Biden will win it in the general election!"
12875,"Well yeah, I'm going to vote for the Democratic nominee but I'm not thrilled with a candidate who has flirted with the idea of putting a Republican on the ballot as the Democratic nominee for VP. 

I don't think you're taking the time to consider the extent to which sticking a member of the GOP on the ballot is s assault on the core of the Democratic party."
12876,"I can’t see how it’s not Harris. She’s a woman of color, reliably liberal, and not repulsive to young voters. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin could work if he’s really worried about holding onto the Midwest."
12877,Happy to have you with us! :)
12878,NO MALARKY I PROMISE
12879,Grow up
12880,Which also benefits Mark Kelly.
12881,I've heard rumours about Joe being accused of sexual assault. Does anyone here have the full story?
12882,"The Bros are a very loud minority of Sanders' supporters. They sicken me too. Right after Pete announced he was dropping out, a bunch of Bros went on the Pete sub and started shitting over everyone.  It makes me want facepalm my hand through the back of my skull. That toxic divisiveness is the reason the left has such a hard holding onto the office. Fuck the Bernie Bros.

-a normal guy who voted for Bernie in the Primary"
12883,"This is a simple message

We don’t need to adopt Marxism to have quality healthcare and education

Marxism isn’t the answer 

This is the one reason I can’t vote for Bernie, I’m a capitalist. We can have capitalism and healthcare. We don’t need to give the government control of most industries and seize 20% of every American business to get fucking healthcare."
12884,My concern is his age. And if he's strong enough to withstand the attack from Trump base. And his supporters have to show up and work for him. Hillary supporters proved absolutely impotent against the Trump campaign.
12885,"Asking him to violate his NDA which proved literally nothing in the end, knowing full well he’d be crushed by financial debt is evil. If it were a man doing it to a woman, you’d be literally calling for his head.

The least she could have done is offer to pay his legal fees if he’s sued, but she wouldn’t even do that. How you can be ok with that kind of behavior speaks to the kind of person you are.

And then for her to defend women in NDAs to Bloomberg after tearing into Pete for refusing to violate his. Just completely cruel."
12886,There are other issues on the ballot outside of the democratic primary.
12887,Sup
12888,"Seriously, any of them would. I don't know where this idea that Trump is some tough, brilliant debater comes from. According to polling, audiences thought he lost all three debates with Clinton. He won the electoral college for other reasons. Not because he was so good at debating."
12889,"Free CC is important, but I went to CC and my in-state 4-year college, and I still ended up with tons of debt from grad school. My state didn't have a program in my (healthcare) field, so I had to go out of state. My family was working class, and I was the first in my family to attend college. If we don't make grad school also affordable and accessible (by also making student loan payments affordable), the working class will be locked out of opportunities."
12890,Yet it won’t matter when Trump suspends elections.
12891,Made a bunch of calls for Joe in WA on Sunday!!!
12892,He was a frequent poster in T_D. Just trying to stir shit up.
12893,https://imgur.com/t/funny/NOtSkd3
12894,Exactly.  I'll admit he's not exactly my favorite person in the world but the fact that he tried to hold Donald Trump accountable suggests that he didn't screw over Hillary due to malice.
12895,How sure are you those people posting in the_donald are actual democrats and Bernie supporters?
12896,He also felt the need to attack the rollout of the Obamacare website for some reason? Bringing up  a competent president that we’d all love to have leading the country during a public health crisis is an interesting move
12897,I would've kept it and thanked her for the new ipad.
12898,Joes rich enough to have great medical help. He’ll be ok
12899,"He wasn't fighting him.  I think it's fine.  What people are gonna watch the video and decide that Biden is not the candidate for them?

Biden is impulsive.  I know this, but it shows authenticity more than it shows incompetence because people see Biden, as a long time senator and VP to be very competent so it doesn't hurt him.

He is winning in the areas where Clinton struggled, white working class rural voters and suburban conservatives and moderates.  He is the right candidate at the right time."
12900,Once Bernie gets added it’s gonna be one hell of a shirt
12901,"Secretary of State, please make him Secretary of State. I can’t imagine a better person to present us in these trying times."
12902,"Don't get complacent folks, translate this in to real votes and high turnout"
12903,Pennsylvania is gonna be Biden country!
12904,His name isn’t Bernie Sanders.
12905,Personally started supporting Joe after both Yang and Buttigieg dropped out (I liked Joe better but thought Buttigieg was more likely to win.) I can't wait to share my support too.
12906,"Oh, they'll thrash for a month, go through the grief stages, but they'll climb on board as Trump keeps botching a pandemic."
12907,"Literally, it is the Hervis Rogers of the world that make America great!  We should all remember how many people have given their lives so that we get to vote.  Let's make sure to get Joe across the line in November so that our democracy can stand."
12908,"I’m a trans lesbian who’s come over from Pete after originally supporting Beto.

I’m still bitter that Bernie supporters are center right to most of the community."
12909,"Y’all are sleeping on my girl, Amy."
12910,"Yeah honestly, I don’t understand how his fans believe he’s equivalent to some ascetic living in a box, travels solely by foot, lives off the land, and has to beg for alms.

The dude is probably wealthier than vast majority of his supporters who think he’s some commoner"
12911,And it’s hard to explain it to his supporters because they’re so binary (you’re either 100% for Bernie or 100% against) and uncompromising.

12913,fuck yeah I would. Ive spent a lot of time and a lot of money(well a lot for me) campaigning for bernie and him picking a progressive VP would be a huge deal for me. I cant overstate how much that would help with the progressive voters.
12914,"* ****  
Nothing directly to do with Joe Biden or uniting the Democratic voter base."
12915,"Biden is crushing Bernie in almost every swing state, so what is the logic behind this?"
12916,"I think it is certainly interesting that Bernie is under performing his 2016 numbers, especially in the former caucus states that kept alive in 2016. I would think Bernie wins Washington, but that it is fairly close."
12917,"Yes, you probably do!"
12918,A reporter for the Houston public media said he voted for joe Biden on Twitter. But that’s the only source I’ve found. There’s a video where he refuses to say who he voted for though.
12919,"And that's part of Pelosi's job description, not Tulsi's."
12920,Team Pete checking in from Tennessee. Cast my ballot for Diamond Joe while wearing my ROTR shirt. Go Joe!
12921,Can't wait for the Young Turks meltdown.
12922,"I think there may be some misunderstanding here about who the “bad guys” are. If we’re talking about Trump and the progressive agenda...he’s your bad guy. He mocks disabled people, bullies/name calls/belittles opponents and world leaders, he lies constantly, he’s dismantled the EPA, silenced the CDC, and is on track to make abortion illegal with his Supreme Court picks. This man is horrible for our country. Not voting because you don’t feel connected to Joe Biden is not in your best interest. Your vote is important. This will probably be the most important political race of your life, regardless of if Bernie or Biden go up against Trump...don’t bail.

12926,"Millions of people own AR-15s though. For those folks. There is no difference.

I'd also add that Biden is advocating for voluntary buybacks. Not mandatory ones. He isn't coming for the guns you own already regardless."
12927,"I think if around 80% of Bernie voters support Biden in the general, then Trump will lose."
12928,"Well, I grew up here, have lived here 3x as long as you, and can tell you it is a fact that the roads suck."
12929,"First, the downvote wasn’t necessary, but I’m grateful you explained your disagreement. We’re on the same page about the minority who do cult worship Bernie and Trump. These people are not going to be swayed at all. Ever. 

To your point about poisoning the well, that’s fair and one of the reasons I want Bernie to drop out when he feels Biden has gone as far left as he will go. We need a break for tempers to die down between Democrats and just let Trump keep doing more and more stupid shit that pisses people off. And that’s free!"
12930,dead ringer
12931,"Sanders thinks [women want to be gang-raped](https://nypost.com/2015/06/05/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-reveals-left-wing-hypocrisy/) and [supported gun manufacturer immunity after Sandy Hook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/nra-helped-elect-bernie-sanders-why-wont-he-admit-it/).

Tell your friends on the Sanders subs!"
12932,That's the biggest one. Russia has shit tons of money invested in who our next president is. All you have to know is they like Bernie.
12933,Now we’re talking! Republicans vs Democrats in this historical debate! Only $40 and when the democratic candidates are selected they’ll notify you to purchase the additional pieces
12934,IL and OH said on Friday they were still going through with it. I think it’s too late to cancel at this point.
12935,"I guess that's attitude to refuse to engage is exactly why you won't gain the support of the Sanders crowd. I am shocked that you don't think you need it. Biden can't galvanize enough people to go out and vote. Unless the plan is ""well Obama is going to support us and that will drive us over the top"" if that's the belief you're delusional."
12936,"COME ON JUAT ADOPT HIM ALREADY

Make bidegieg happen 😍"
12937,I’m not sure if the exact time of the interview but Meet the Press starts at 10 PM ET.
12938,Why does it seem like 538 is the only news outlet acknowledging that the race for the nomination is essentially over??
12939,"More and more false attacks on Biden's health are showing up on /politics.  It's aggravating that they'll stoop to anything, even mocking a stutter."
12940,me too!
12941,Thank you but EMOJIS really cringe normal
12942,He already is converting republican moderates.  Many have said they would consider voting for Biden but never vote for Sanders.
12943,They can believe in Bernie’s policy platform and still be willing to come unify for Biden as he secures the nomination. Let’s be respectful and accepting as they come. No need for hostility.
12944,"Debate winners don't do well in subsequent elections. Polls had Hillary winning all three debates against Trump.
Elizabeth Warren allegedly won the Nevada debate, and she was fourth in the caucuses.
This suggests that people don't use debates as a factor to vote (at all)."
12945,"Theres going to be a percentage who won't vote for either candidate. The suburban vote is overwhelmingly not going to vote for a socialist regardless of how anybody feels about the term.

Obamas job will be to unite even if it won't heal completely. It would be even harder if he literally endorsed the competition."
12946,"True. It's been a while now, and nobody has touched it, and it hasn't been trending on twitter for several hours. I'm glad the media got some sense from 2016 and chose not to broadcast it. The top Biden search results are the new fox poll (good news!!) and his CNN town hall, and it seems to have dipped off the radar. If it doesn't come up in the next few days, we should be in the clear."
12947,"Thanks. It seems Bernie stans forgot to vote. For weeks, I've been seeing his annoying north korean level propaganda on r all. Are they gonna stop now?

PS: I'm not American"

12949,Oh dang you’re right
12950,"Wisconsin will be tough - in 2018, we had Tammy Baldwin on the ballot, and she in turn carried Tony Evers to a razor-thin win over Scott Walker for the governorship. But, there are no statewide races in 2020, and our congressional seats are gerrymandered into security - 3 for the Dems, 5 for the GOP, and that won't change this year.

For Biden to win, he needs HUGE turnout in Milwaukee among black voters, and he needs to win over a very Bernie-friendly city in Madison, with a large number of bumper sticker liberals that will vote Green Party before ""the establishment""."

12966,Turns out David Bowie was holding reality together.
12967,Ok dnc goon
12968,"I don't see much to be worried about. The 10th Biden should run away with Missouri and Mississippi. Michigan seems like it should be a win. No idea about North Dakota, Idaho, and Washington. Then the 17th it seems very likely Biden could win all 5 states. If that happens it would likely be a lead unable to be overcome. Then add in Georgia on the 24th and it is hard to see where Bernie gets any traction."
12969,"A expropriation of 20% of wealth, as a tax, would also be a hard no from me. With shares its more nefarious because people are being robbed of their *ownership* as well."

12972,"I think you're being a bit disingenuous here. Biden's plan, as far as I'm aware, does plan ACA expansion plus a public option which would cover it.

12981,"Yea man.

With the virus situation in the world, we need to narrow down our focus in the showdown this year.

Everyone has seen bare how Trump has also fucked up his own supporters; because surprise! The virus DGAF about how hardcore you are for Trump. So those supporters will also feel the impact, along with no more economic benefits that Trump touted."

I think that Baker could appoint one, but there would need to be a special election 145 days after it.  There's also the potential that Baker could go for the seat and potentially win, he's still fairly popular, although Massachusetts is pretty hostile towards its Republicans once they try for the Federal Government"

12988,"Yup. They called white women ""wine moms"" and black voters ""low information."" They called never Trumpers Nazis. Now they are throwing in with the alt right.

Bernie supporters online aren't representative of any large group of voters. They certainly aren't representative of the millions of people who voted for Bernie in 2016. His movement is shrinking and it's getting nastier as it does. We need to stay above the fray and let all of the non-alt-right people back in the club."
12989,"Yeah, that's sort of what I mean, when it's bad enough the candidates themselves are calling it out..."
12990,"It felt like a really aggressive speech rather than a ""listen to my ideas"" speech. When I listened to it, it felt like Bernie was saying that Biden's policy positions aren't meaningfully dealing with the issues Bernie cares about.

A ""listen to my ideas"" speech could've just been a private talk with Biden, maybe getting Biden to agree to some ideas, endorsing him, and then explaining how Biden is achieving progressive goals in a speech."

13003,"Warren is a great policy wonk but she projects too a progressive of an image to mesh will with Biden.

Abrams would be a great pick 8 years from now but she doesn’t really have any presidential level credentials.

Harris would be a fantastic choice, she’s an excellent speaker, projects an aura of joy and excitement and despite being 55 seems young
And fresh, something Biden sorely needs.

Buttigieg , like Harris is a great speaker but two white males doesn’t cast the net of our appeal wide enough in my opinion.

I think Kamala would be an excellent choice, but she hasn’t endorsed Biden as of now, so we’ll see how it goes."
13004,I have been nothing but welcoming to Pete supporters but it seems there’s little willingness to understand.  I don’t need to read a rank and file book by another FBI to know what happened. Peace out.
13005,Too controversial.
13006,"Bernie is still in the race, you can still vote for him and support Biden in the fall. Bernie has fought so hard for us. Stick with him for one more week. Obviously this will not be popular here. The fact is that only half the delegates have been awarded. Now that there are only two people left, we can finally get a robust discussion around policies, which could help improve Biden's positions a bit before the general."
13007,"Man do I love Sally Yates, especially that they will be going up against Trump. That’s my personal pick with Kamala as a strong second but her attacks on Biden will be in all GOP political ads if she’s the VP Pick"

13012,"I prefer optimistic, not naive. If this debate in anyway lends an olive branch to two groups of voters who may very well decide the fate of this election (youth and Hispanic), then Sanders’ satisfaction could be a key. 

Anyway, this is just my perspective. Feel free to feel differently. Just wanted to share my thoughts."
13013,Will this delay results?
13014,Hopefully she'll learn from this campaign and be back stronger in future elections!
13015,He’s facing Donald Trump. The gaffe king. Donald Trump is the perfect opponent for Joe Biden specifically because all of Joe’s weaknesses are much worse in Trump rendering those aspects less impactful head to head. Then it comes down to ideas and experience and Biden being liked and Trump being hated.
13016,Thanks to everyone who responded. Can't say I agree but I appreciate y'all sharing your perspectives
13017,No one's saying this.
13018,Republicans voting to help Trump. Biden would be a cakewalk.
13019,"I say this as a Sanders supporter, you'll have to ignore the trolls and seek out the ones who have been at least for the most part trying to act in good faith. There's people now in the /r/politics thread saying that Biden voters welcome them over at /r/neoliberal, but at the moment that's being as toxic on the other side of the scale. Now's a bad time to throw out olive branches it seems, but while waiting for the dust to clear you should be at least keeping an eye out, because there are many of us who see the writing on the wall and while we may not fully support Biden now we want to at least be able to put our feet forward if and when Bernie drops out or loses. We may not be many, but there are some of us now who are acting in good faith and are sticking out olive branches of our own. Right now, those are the people you want to find, because they'll stick out past the trolls and will give real consideration.

Once the primary is over, then there's the concerns about Sanders supporters who will consider voting non-blue, if voting at all. I'm not going to lie, those people are still out there, and that's a concern. It's going to be a difficult fight ahead, and once again in the end it'll be whoever the Democrats nominate vs Trump. The difference here is there's no more baseless fearmongering of what Trump may do, we have absolute proof of what we're dealing with, and that should make it a damn sight easier to rile people up against. 

Also, there is quite a lot in Biden's campaign promises that would appeal to progressives. It's not given much light though as a lot of what gets highlighted from it are the more moderate proposals. It'll be hard to win over any that go third party and vote purely on policy preferences if their policy preferences align more towards a third party candidate. The others though, the ones who would rather just skip the vote out of spite or vote Trump because ""at least we know what we're getting"" or what other nonsense may come out, those voters are the ones we have the best shot at getting back in. The key thing will be to have messaging that brings together keeping some moderate ideas while bringing on progressive ideas and not just paying lip service. 

TLDR: Am Sanders supporter, I do acknowledge that much of what you've said is quite correct, but when the only option left is the nominated candidate vs Trump that's when it'll be far easier to weed out all the trolls and toxic people from the people we really need to reach. May the democrats win November."

Getting blown out state after state is embarrassing for a guy who was supposedly so popular and would bring new voters to the party. Seems joe did what sanders couldn’t. Who says we need sanders voters? Seems you guys are gaslighting yourselves. You can vote to stop trump because it’s the right thing to do or try blackmail again. Either way we’ve moved on.
13030,"The Intercept didn't report on the allegations, only that Time's Up didn't pursue an investigation"

You have to pick which battles to fight, make compromises with people/situations you might not like, and accept that everything isn't going to work out exactly like you imagined, but you still show up and try. I don't believe Bernie is going to convince a nation of conservatives and conservative-leaning moderates to adopt widespread social programs ran by the government. Definitely not in 4 years, maybe not even in 8 years.

 We have to build a bridge of common understanding through *action* and *reasoning*. America is basically split down the middle in terms of political leanings, and it's going to take more than just the people whom are like us and some wishful thinking to bring about change."

When hanging out in the sub, you’ll hear talk of the ‘big tent,’ and we mean it - this campaign is one that’s made up of a true, actual multi-demographic coalition with the openness of ideas. We’re seeing this with Joe coming out in support of a number of Warrens campaign proposals and finally acknowledging Yang’s notion of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 

Admittedly, I too was a Sanders supporter in 16,’ and the tipping point for me that compelled me to defect from his camp was the toxicity that adulterated his campaign. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll will admit that I didn’t support Joe in the begin and remained skeptical about him for sometime. I backed Kamala and ended up voting for Pete before Super Tuesday. However, I’ve grown more comfortable with Joe’s campaign, knowing that not only would he be the most progressive candidate in decades but his longtime experience will pave a pathway for a more progressive future."

13079,See and I feel the opposite. I respect the supporters because social media is only a very small percentage of Sanders fan base. It’s Sanders who I distrust based on large promises with no way to deliver. I’m very ready for him to drop out and to welcome all his supporters on and offline.

Signed a resolution as mayor of Burlington affirming that marriage is between “husband and wife” https://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/02/06/clinton-surrogates-pounce-on-sanders-over-82-marriage-resolution/

Argued same-sex marriage was a states’ rights issue in 2006 https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=57&amp;v=kej9QAsS3uI&amp;feature=emb_logo

In 2006, after same-sex civil unions had been legal in Vermont since 2000, responded to a reporter asking if same-sex marriage should be legalized in Vermont with “Not right now,” after the “very divisive debate” preceding the civil union legislation

From the buzz feed piece I linked above:

In 1992, for example, Biden voted to block an amendment that would have denied benefits to same-sex partners in the District of Columbia. 


When Obama chose Biden as his running mate in 2008, the Advocate, a leading LGBTQ publication, emphasized Biden's support from gay leaders in Delaware and his “84% average on nine congressional scorecards issued by the Human Rights Campaign since 1989.” 

Biden supporters also note his work to advance a hate crimes prevention bill — named after Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming man beat to death in 1998 — signed by Obama 10 years ago this month.

Biden had hinted several weeks earlier, behind closed doors at a fundraiser hosted by a gay couple, that his thinking had changed. (“Things are changing so rapidly, it’s going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say, ‘I oppose gay marriage,’” Biden said at the event, according to a 2014 account in the New York Times.)"

There are two main reasons for this.  The most important being because of the fundamental problem that ended up destroying Obamacare from the inside - If a private insurance company is able to reimburse a healthcare facility for rendered services with more money than the government is willing to, that facility will have financial incentive to prioritize private insurance patients over others.  With ObamaCare, many doctors and facilities ended up opting out because they would get higher checks from private insurance.  Since the most marginalized among us can’t afford private insurance, we stay stuck in the immoral reality that the level and quality of care you can receive is directly and solely based on wealth.

The second, less “life-or-death” (pun intended) reason being you shouldn’t have to be paying a private company for services your taxes are already paying for!  So if you as an American are paying taxes into a M4A system that covers basic doctor visits, prescriptions, preventive car, etc, then Insurance Company A should not be able to include (read: charge you) these in their own policies. So, there WILL be non-essential medical procedures, treatments, etc that won’t be covered under M4A, which under Bernie’s plan you WILL be able to purchase private insurance for.  You  just shouldn’t be “double-charged” for the essential care your taxes already pay for."
13103,North Dakota is going to be interesting tomorrow.  They are going to get slaughtered by the Saudi's. It's not crazy to think that ND could get flipped by a guy like Joe.
13104,The margin is down to 450 votes in Texas. It looks like Biden is starting to pull ahead.
13105,Of course he isn’t. He somehow thinks that he and his millions pouring over footage of over 30 years of Joe Biden’s career and ripping him constantly is somehow stopping Donald Trump. He has zero idea of working with others to defeat Trump at all. He is only interested in keeping his $100 million dollar campaign operation alive to pay for as many people he knows as long as possible. This isn’t about winning the nomination. He’s smart enough to know he can’t now. This is about wealth redistribution from his supporters to his own campaign staff indefinitely and hoping for another 4 years of Trump to increase his chances of M4all later.

13107," (this was originally a post reply but I think this might be useful information in general so I decided to post it as a stand-alone comment. Please feel free to add/edit this comment and copy paste it etc.)

Let's look at the hard numbers. I  have posted below a link to ""govtracker"" that goes over the voting  history of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

GovTrack: [Bernie](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357)

GovTrack: [Biden](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joseph_biden/300008)

Based  on the numbers Biden has been a primary sponsor on 42 pieces of  legislation that have been passed. Bernie has been a primary sponsor on  7. This alone should give you an idea of who is better at the politics  of getting Washington to move. Now, let's break this down into some more  specifics. Based on this link ([https://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislative-landmarks](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislative-landmarks))  posted by helo323 we can perform a more detailed analysis of what  Bernie Sanders and his staff consider to be his legislative  accomplishments.

If you do a  simple ctrl+F command and search for ""vote"" and highlight all you see  that most of the terms related to ""vote"" or ""voted"" are ""voted against""  or ""voted no."" The legislation that Mr. Sander's has authored or passed  includes: (based off of the article that you linked)

Proposed

* Break up too big to fail banks (didn't pass)
* Proposed a progressive tax law (didn't pass)

Amendments

* Fed audit [(GAO-11-696)](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf)  (passed)
* Medicare expansion  ([S.Amdt.2837 to S.Amdt.2786](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/111th-congress/senate-amendment/2837?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SA+2837%22%5D%7D))  (didn't pass)
* Pension and age discrimination re IBM (passed)
* Amendment re Citizens United (didn't pass)

Legislation that Sander's has voted ""no"" or ""against"" on

* War in Iraq (wise)
* First Gulf War (we weren't supposed to keep Kuwait from being treated like the Kurds?)
* Patriot Act (makes sense)
* Wall street de-regulation (reasonable)
* Voted against tax cuts (again, makes sense since the 2003 cuts were aimed at the wealthy)
* Voted against NAFTA (in line with platform)
* Voted against keystone XL
* Voted against law which didn't provide benefit equality for same-sex marriages in 1996

Based  on this article none of these are major accomplishments legislatively.  These are all fairly boiler plate and the stuff that he authored which  did pass didn't require any form of bipartisan support because they were  widely popular pieces of legislation anyway. None of these pieces of  legislation required any form of coalition building which sort of proves  detractors point that Bernie is bad at actually passing legislation."

13127,"This is the #2 article in the Wash Po.  

ARTICLE:

It is an encouraging sign that in a speech Thursday afternoon, Joe Biden directly took on one of the very worst aspects of President Trump’s response to coronavirus: His use of the disease to fuel reactionary nationalist panic.

This bodes well for the coming campaign, should Biden become the Democratic nominee. It suggests that he may offer a sustained case against Trump’s xenophobic nationalism on other fronts, particularly immigration and trade, and weave it into a broader argument against Trumpism.

In his speech Thursday, Biden offered a sweeping critique of Trump’s handling of coronavirus, and put forth his own vision for responding to it. Biden proposed government funding for widespread free testing and assistance with paying for treatment; paid sick leave on an emergency and a permanent basis; and many other ideas.


One could criticize Biden’s blueprint from the left: He didn’t propose free treatment, and he didn’t mount as aggressive a call for universal health care as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has done. But Biden offered a robust vision.

Meanwhile, in indicting Trump’s response, Biden focused squarely on Trump’s serial lying and downplaying of coronavirus’s seriousness in defiance of his own experts, and his systematic degradation of science and empirically grounded government.

But I wanted to flag this extended portion of Biden’s speech in particular:

&gt;We’ll never fully solve this problem if we’re unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the rest of the world. A disease that starts anywhere on the planet, can get on a plane to any city on earth within a few hours. We have to confront coronavirus everywhere. We should be leading a coordinated, global response, just as we did to the Ebola crisis, that draws on the incredible capability of the U.S. Agency for International Development and our State Department, to assist vulnerable nations in detecting and treating the coronavirus wherever it spreads.

&gt; We should be investing in rebuilding and strengthening the global health security agenda, which we launched during our administration, specifically to mobilize the world against the threats of new infectious diseases.

&gt; It can be hard to see the concrete value of this work when everything seem to be going well in the world. But by cutting our investments in global health, this administration has left us woefully unprepared for the crisis we now face. No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you this. When I’m president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We’ll lead with science. We’ll listen to the experts. We’ll heed their advice. We’ll build American leadership and rebuild it, to rally the world to meet the global threats that we’re likely to face again.

&gt; And I’ll always tell you the truth. This is the responsibility of a president.

Trump and his advisers have used the crisis to try to invigorate his reactionary nationalist vision. Trump has dementedly tweeted that his border wall will save us from the virus. He has blamed Europeans for the spread of a “foreign virus” here. Top Cabinet officials and GOP senators have taken to calling it the “Wuhan virus.”

There are more sophisticated versions of this argument. Some Trump advisers have pushed the idea that coronavirus, and the threat to the global economy posed by China’s travails, show that we’re overly dependent on foreign-manufactured goods and global supply chains. And others have hinted that in some general sense, coronavirus undercuts the cosmopolitan and globalist mindset.

None of this makes any sense. Globalization is a way of organizing the global flow of goods and migration, but coronavirus been imported here by travel to and from the United States. Those two things, obviously, aren’t the same thing. And as Biden points out, we’re not going to stop the latter from happening in any concerted way.

Indeed, none of the things we associate with globalization are in any meaningful sense responsible for the coronavirus crisis.

On immigration, as Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam point out, there has been “no known U.S. case in which someone brought the virus to the U.S. while immigrating or making an asylum claim.”

But even if this became a serious problem, a temporary ban on certain types of immigration in response to a crisis like this one would not be in the least incompatible with tolerating generous legal immigration and asylum/refugee flows as a general matter, in non-crisis times. Even open-border advocates such as Alex Nowrasteh support temporary restrictions for such reasons.

On trade, previous global pandemics have caused worry about global supply chains. But as Robert Armstrong points out in the Financial Times, in those cases companies have responded by geographically diversifying supply chains to spread exposure and vulnerability around, not with a huge push to unwind them and make all production domestic again.

Our international trade system does have serious problems and negative impacts, but those call for revamped international trade deals and institutions. And if trade with China creates vulnerabilities for us, the far more likely answer to that would be a new industrial policy.

It would be folly to judge international trade writ large through the prism of our dependence on China supposedly revealed by coronavirus, since even if you conceded this as a cost, you’d have to weigh the benefits of international trade against it.

Coronavirus has spread in the United States largely because the response was tainted at the outset by a president who downplayed facts and reality for cynical political reasons, resulting in a string of delays, mixed signals and an incompetent government response. The culprit was not our open society. Preventing the spread will require extensive intra-border reductions in social mixing and better, sounder, more empirically grounded government — in short, better domestic and international leadership.

In this sense, it’s crucial that Biden condemned Trump’s xenophobic fearmongering and his disdain for facts, science and reality-based international cooperation in the same passage. Because those things are intimately intertwined with each other, and feed off similar impulses. In making this big argument, Biden has set a promising template for the campaign to come."

If even just a thousand extra people get corona as a result of hundreds of thousands of people going to the polls to vote, those thousand people will infect all their family members and hundreds of people will die needlessly just to hold the primary.

13216,"Student loan debt forgiveness still doesn't make sense for these important service fields. 


Doctors and nurses are extremely well paid. They don't need any kind of student debt relief. That's the entire point of taking out your loan - to get a well paying job that makes the loan worthwhile. 



Why anyone would go to college to become a food service/grocery/retail worker, I don't know. Most people in these fields don't have college degrees. If you want to give these vulnerable industries some sort of special protection in a stimulus bill, that makes sense to me, but I don't see how student debt forgiveness makes any sense for these fields either.


This is an unpopular opinion, but teachers are often well paid for the amount of work they do. That being said, I do personally think there are some instances where they could be the focus of some sort of debt relief. As I understand, there have been and continue to be many efforts towards that goal. I don't think coronavirus related debt forgiveness is the right tool here, either."

13222,What a shock.
13223,"&gt;The margins were thin enough that multiple small changes could have done it

My point exactly and I agree.

&gt;It's less about blame and more about recognizing a weakness regarding our most serious geopolitical foe.

What weakness?

&gt;I'm not sure that's actually true. Hillary did over 100 events for Obama, Bernie did fewer than that. 

That's untrue. Sanders did over 4 times as many rallies for Clinton than she did Obama.

&gt;Hillary was much closer winning than Bernie was. 

Yet still mathematically impossible, yes? So what's the difference? Furthermore, saying your staying in the race in case your opponent gets assassinated is egregious and offensive. You can't complain about Sanders staying in the race and then defend Clinton for doing the same thing, you have to pick one.

&gt;By refusing to hold them accountable for their attacks against the US and Ukraine. The various sanctions passed cost Putin and his oligarchs billions of dollars a year.

When has Russia attacked the US? The Crimea fiasco happened under Obama btw."
13224,True
13225,Don’t worry your essentially still voting for a republican

Everyone seems to love her, and I’m not arguing with her character at all. But, for all the podcasts and analysis I listen to, I’ve never heard anyone argue that she’s actually ready to do the job."
13229,I guess I would ask you a question first: why after being a lifelong Republican are you considering dumping Trump?

13232,"In HS I loved Sanders- this old, Independent progressive Senator from Vermont? What's not to love? In 2016, I caucused for him and he won our (now) deep Red state in a landslide. Then as it got closer to the nomination, he changed his tune a bit, or at least turned up the volume and fanaticized his followers- perhaps in desperation. I started to have misgivings. The last three years have seen him take part in the ineffective, hyperpartisan Senate. All the while, this great divide keeps widening between the parties' ""platforms"", with Sanders&amp;Co. digging more and more on their side. Him and Warren have turned their followers into Anti-Trump SJWs the same way Trump built up his Anti-Obama xenophobic nationalists. His followers and colleagues trying to drum up support is as disgusting, disrespectful and unethical as Cruz and Rubio and Graham (wtf happened there?) rallying for Trump."
13233,"&gt;You are the only person who finds thousands of people dying humerous.

What?

&gt;I would absolutely criticize anyone with a 0% chance who stayed in a race, pandemic or no pandemic.

So you are not criticizing Bernie then I assume.  Cause he still has a more than 0% chance of winning."
13234,"I posted the link to the full video in a separate comment

But that’s besides the point. The better question is why is Sanders attacking Biden from the left when that will only help Trump in November? If Bernie is so damn great how about he and his supporters promote him and his policies without attacking Biden and doing Trump’s work for him?"

13238,I would have supported pretty much anyone against Hillary.
13239,Mid-20s bi trans dude here. I hopped on over from Pete's camp :)
13240,Biden is starting to shift left.  Sanders needs to drop out and support Biden and convince his followers to support Biden.  If you are willing you have another 4 years of Trump because Bernie isn't the nominee you don't give a fuck about what Sanders stood for.
13241,"I’ll be stunned if he drops out. He can’t help himself and will insist on one more debate.

I wish he would suspend but I don’t think he will today."
13242,"They ran ads with joe biden touting bipartisan support from this speech, and they won. That's campaigning. He needs to do better. Do not help the opponents.

He, personally thought ""I will praise this republican for $200,000 even though I do not have to"" and then they ran ads on it and won. Either he did this on purpose, or doesn't understand politics at all. Which is it?"
13243,"Pete would be better in a more... open environment. VP is good, don't get me wrong, but VP really doesn't open a lot of international doors as SoS.

He might, but I don't think Pete will carry Indiana for us. That's a pretty solid chunk of red."

13250,"wouldnt the people still have to go to Vote for biden even If He is the only candidate? I dont know If Bill weld is in every ballot for the republicans, but i've read that they also Vote in an ""uncontested primary"" whatever that means."
13251,"You know, if you're hoping to change some minds, this isn't the best way to go about it."
13252,"Dude, you clearly haven't read my history. I'm a Warren Democrat and voted for her on Super Tuesday. I'm blue no matter who, even if it is freaking ""present"" Tulsi Gabbard. ALL of the divisiveness I've experienced has been from Sanders' supporters, in my workplace and from former friends as well as online. So yeah, he's not my #2 or #3, but he somehow wins then I'll hold my nose and vote for him.  THIS progressive wanted Warren, desperately. I'm lucky to have been able to vote for her. I'm still Persisting, and working to get NC and SC to go blue in the Senate. I'm working to get Democrats in my NC legislature to try to end the damn gerrymandering GOP stranglehold out of my local politics and courtrooms. So I AM canvassing still and trying to get out the vote. I don't give a damn what someone claims online because I'm too busy meeting real people, as well as working.

If you want to be upset about Sanders coming off during this last debate as someone who is not capable of deviating from his campaign speech, talk to him and his staff.  M4A isn't going to help the current pandemic, which is why I think Biden did better answering what he would do NOW. Biden has started to adopt some progressive policies. As Warren said, Take what you can get and then ask for more. We don't have to stop pushing for more."
13253,Not run off employers and endorse populists over strong female candidates.
13254,Better late than never

13257,"We’re close to the same age (I’m a bit younger and can’t vote yet), but we’ve had very similar experiences. I feel the same way.

I was watching Race to the White House on CNN a little while ago. It was the Obama vs. McCain episode. It made me realize how DECENT politics was back then. McCain refused to spread false rumors about Obama. Obama was inspiring and a gracious winner. I miss it, even though I barely remember it.

I hope every day that a Biden win will be a return to a time like that."
13258,"Okay, what are they?"
13259,"It’s trying to kick the fascists out while communists are rioting in streets. That being said, we have until November and the virus has sucked the oxygen out of the air and makes it tougher for Joe to start making his case to the general public."
13260,dress for the job you *want*
13261,"There's at least a strong case that the DNC influenced voting by creating a sense of *fait accompli* with Clinton. People tend to vote for who they think is winning, so when the entire media was declaring Clinton the winner before a single vote had been cast, that could easily make a difference of 4 million votes. But this time there was no such narrative being pushed on the media by the DNC."
13262,Idk enough about Tulsi to say I support her personally but I will say that I too am (generally) against regime change wars also. They create a power vacuum which tends to give us even worse leaders.
13263,I think what you are doing right now is a step in the right direction.
13264,25 year old gay Klobber that made the switch to Biden.
13265,I haven’t felt this optimistic about politics since the day after the 2018 midterms. Thank you Joe!
13266,Trump will win again.
13267,"Congratulations to Biden. He’s not my first pick, but I look forward to voting for him in November."
13268,Local stuff tends to have lower turnout though!
13269,We keep getting the emergency alert system! Lol! Hard to watch this thing.
13270,"I had tears.  To see Joe compare him to Beau... wow.  I wish he was better at debating, but this is the Joe we need.  Our country is going to need to heal after Trump is gone, and Joe showed me a kind man who can do that.  My heart was broken when Pete left, but that was such an incredible moment.  He understands why we love Pete.  I’m behind Joe."
13271,"I think we'd be lucky to even get one of those within the month of March. Pete unfortunately ( great guy otherwise) needs an Ego check and Amy feels she owes Minnesota the Super Tuesday attempt. 

Was kinda hoping Amy might still decide in the next few hours to drop"
13272,"&gt; No ones keeping you here.


How welcoming you are, friend.


I voted Bernie in 2016 then Clinton in the general. I will vote for Bernie in my primary and then for whoever the Dem nominee is.


I'm here because I want Trump gone and it appears Joe will likely get the nomination.

13275,"I think that's a very good point. I've heard a lot of Sanders supporters say they don't care about economic issues. They don't care if corporations make less money. And while I certainly understand that sentiment,  I think a lot of them fail to realize that a poor economy hurts working just as much, if not more so, as corporations."

13281,Welcome to the team we are happy to have you
13282,Idt it’s fair to say Bernie supporters don’t need any concessions from Joe.  Most people like to see a candidate adopt policies they support.  Biden adopted a couple of Warren’s policies after she dropped for example.
13283,You just want to try to one up the policies bro. Nice try
13284,"Bloomberg can’f actually incorporate it into the actual Biden campaign.  He’s limited by campaign finance laws.  So it’s going to have to become a pro-Biden SuperPAC.


However, I think the better strategy is to let Bloomberg’s agency continue making ads criticizing Trump and showing how he’s unfit for the Presidency among independents/undecided voters.  Let the actual Biden Campaign focus on the primary and finish this thing off over the next 2-3 weeks."
13285,"If I'm forced to entertain your parallel dimension scenario, no, he should not.
Now, if the most plausible scenario happens, which is Biden winning big in all 4 states like all polls are saying, should Bernie drop out?"

13289,I'm confused
13290,"Degrees. If the suffering of people of color is less important to you than pushing some fantasy candidate which harms the party and causes losses then yes that means one views POC as lesser. ""As far as I'm concerned"" means it's my opinion. As far as you're concerned he's not and I have no problem with that. White supremacy runs the gamut from entitled privileged jerk (Maher) to Hitler. I realize many see only the extreme as qualifying that designation, but I don't. I'm upvoting your reply."

13294,I voted early by mail in Florida weeks ago for Joe Biden. Everyone I know votes by mail.
13295,"He would support Medicare for All if it was plausible. But, unfortunately, it's not...at least not right now. 

Bernie's plan would cost **at least** $50 trillion over 10 years, which is like 20% of our GDP. And that's the best-case, pie-in-the-sky scenario! His plan is to build upon our current system in every way to achieve virtually the same thing without the huge cost and the catastrophic chaos that would come with tearing down everything.

Same thing, more realistic approach."
13296,Beverly Hills? This will trigger the Berners.

13300,"Rotr doesn't mean you can't call out malarkey when you see it. Pete on that stage showed how you do it. You confront, you deliver, breathe and smile. Everytime he almost gave Bernie a heart attack we got a taste of Bernie's true colors.

I need more of that personally."

13302,"If you can't argue your position in good faith, you should pick a new position."
13303,"When I saw the neighborhood voting data in Minneapolis I could tell exactly where these people would fall.  IMO the Warren voter is the most astute voter, maybe the most educated and if they wanted Bernie they would have rolled that way.  At some point they will roll with pragmatism over altruism, IMO."

13310,u/CharmingShower Bernie bros hate everyone who threatens communism
13311,"I’ve said it before but I’ll say it again: Joe’s willingness to embrace supporter groups as they are has reinforced my decision to support him. He’s building a true coalition and meeting Pete, Amy, Kamala, and Beto supporters where they are. He’s not out there declaring victory over them or trying to say his ideas won out - instead he’s embracing everyone dropping their preferred preference and backing him and he’s trying to meet everyone where they’re at. I won’t speak for other groups or other people, but that has made it so much easier for me to get involved. Pete and his candidacy meant a lot to me, and it means a lot that Joe isn’t asking me to drop it or forget it to support him."
13312,Turning right wing talking points into light hearted self-aware jokes is certainly one way to take the wind out of Russia troll sails

13318,"wow, they have biden up on delegates now too.  what a difference a day makes"
13319,"&gt;	So basically people didn't really change their opinions before and after the debate, with it potentially having been a stalemate.
But still, Bernie kept catching Biden lying. Biden tried to catch Bernie in a lie and when Bernie told him to read off his evidence, Biden nervously laughed and looked away because he was caught again.
It still clearly seems like Bernie did better, but if you liked Biden before then your opinion of him wasn't going to change anyway.

So first part you said people didn’t really change their mind. When in fact the polls show Biden won and +3 in the polls post debate. 

Then you said it was potentially a stalemate and ended your comment with Bernie clearly did better. 

Bernie fans think Biden is lying because you guys have been fed propaganda for too long with manipulated videos. They are all over Sanders sub."
13320,This is good for Bitcoin.
13321,"Wyoming was the last scheduled caucus. 

On the upside, this probably means there will be no more caucuses in the distant future. Every state should have a vote-by-mail system."
13322,Some of those supporters are Trump fans and others are not even American... the rest are brainwashed by those 2 groups
13323,That's nice to hear. I'd say of all the candidates I'm a Warren guy.
13324,Russia's strategy is to destabilize america to the point where we can't intervene in foreign affairs (such as crimea.) Of course they want Sanders to win.
13325,Is Kamala coming 🤞🤞🤞

13334,"TLDR: The Republican party can Constitutionally bypass voters in November and re-elect Trump in November. How? State legislatures can Constitutionally select the electors for the general election, bypassing the voters. Supreme Court uphold this in Bush v Gore. Republicans control 28 state legislatures and 294 electoral votes."
13335,Welcome! We promise we’re not evil.

13340,"Joe doing great. Looking like a commander and chief. His words talk about working with others and getting the job done. I'm really liking Joe's part.

Deep, thoughtful comments and quickly answered. He came 2 win this thing.

I'll keep my Bernie comments mostly 2 my'self in the spirit of unity."
13341,"I support Joe because true change is always incremental.  Radical revolution rarely occurs, and when it does, it's never as people want.

I support Joe because he can get his agenda passed.  He is liked and respected, with a track record of improving the country.  He isn't known for being difficult.

I support Joe because he is the candidate other candidates can support.  He is positive.  He doesn't scapegoat, threaten, or use divisive populist rhetoric of conspiracies when he loses.

I support Joe because his agenda will accelerate our carbon-free future, improve the lives of the poor, tackle the true causes of high health care costs, and restore the promise of America to immigrants we need to build our future.

I support Joe because he will win in November.  He is the only Democrat who has grown turnout in the primaries, won states with no presence whatsoever, and built coalitions.  He has broad support from all demographics, including African Americans, and is opposed by Operation Chaos, Russia, and Trump.  Trump is so scared of Biden he got himself impeached to try and smear him, and still found nothing.

The choice is rapidly becoming Trump or Biden.  Everyone will need to decide which side they're on.  Not joining Team Democrat is what Trump and Russia are counting on."
13342,Maybe he should just drop out instead of fleecing his followers for more private jet fuel.
13343,Can’t wait until Joe wins and avenges HRC and fulfills his purpose of taking down the Dixie Mob in Washington DC and draining the swamp. The series of events that unlocks if and when Joe wins makes for an even better 4 (maybe 8) years ahead of us. It is the very difference between us being America of its glory days again or being something totally different as we know it.
13344,Welcome!
13345,"See, you say that, but Trump hatred drove voters to the polls in droves in the midterm."
13346,"And that's why I'm here. Biden has been my second. I suspect there will be more of us. I think not as many Warren supporters will go to Sanders as many people imagine. I loved her organization, her ability to put numbers to her plans, and the civility of her and her supporters. I don't see any of that in the Sanders camp, so he's not a good fit for me and, I suspect, many others."
13347,"&gt;Can you name one bad faith attack or one debunked right wing conspiracy theory she’s said?

She claimed Kamala Harris was, as CA AG, keeping inmates in prison longer than their sentences to use as slave labor, which is unequivocally false. She based that claim on reporting by the Washington Free Beacon, a GOP smear rag that frequently posts false conspiracy theories. 

She also flirted with [9/11](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-911-conspiracy-theory_n_5dc20b60e4b0b0861f902a99) conspiracy theories and drove full bore into DNC election rigging conspiracies."
13348,Ive given myself enough time amd cant find hard evidence. I'll take back what I said about the DNC until otherwise. I am highly suspicious of the orcastration of things like the Iowa primary and the many synchronised narrative spins against Bernie.

13351,They're cited in the tweets
13352,"So, of former candidates, it goes:

Biden: Pete, Amy, Klob, Harris, Delaney, Patrick, Booker, Beto

Bernie: Williamson, de Blasio

Yikes."
13353,"&gt;I identified it as a bubble the instant Trump approved those tax cuts.

Identified what as a bubble? Wtf are you talking about

That's impressive you can just identify bubbles like that. I know some financial firms who will be willing to hire you for 8+ figures for the magical bubble identifying analyses you pull out your ass.

Come on let's not be as economically illiterate as Bernie supporters

&gt;When stocks drop, the money it represented evaporates.

Stocks do not represent money. They represent the value of the firm"
13354,"Not HRC, she's been going around the media for months criticizing Sanders. She needs to be part of the death blow to the Sanders campaign if she genuinely believes that Sanders contributed even a small portion to her 2016 defeat."
13355,Seeing even Bernie supporters on Reddit talking about how well the speech went.
13356,"Holy fuck I did not know this. Thanks.

Its now obvious Bernie is cherrypicking studies to favour his campaign."
13357,I'm actually convinced that Krystal Ball is the Maria Butina here because of her looks and Reade is complicit. Hate going McCarthyism but we can assume the Russians are colluding with some fringe left media outlets to spread the disinformation campaign.
13358,"I’m aware of Joe’s past statements about social security, but can’t he either own it and say he changed course or pull a trump and deny it, saying he strongly supports keeping it as is?"
13359,"and on top of that, Pete was a progressive."
13360,"As a Bernie supporter, I have to ask: What do you think the common goals we've ""had all along are exactly""?

Please don't say ""Decency"". I'm genuinely curious what goals you think Bernie's progressive movement and Biden's campaign have in common.

Thanks in advance"
13361,Head-to-head against Trump in Battleground states Biden 51-45 Bernie 49-46
13362,"&gt;but he will be also more pressing on issues like M4A and climate change.

Why? Isn't Biden already fairly progressive on both fronts?"
13363,I was a Pete guy but only because he was able to stay in the race longer. Cory would have made my decision difficult. He's too good for us.
13364,"Same here. Or any case I’m ideologically conservative. In the future I’ll probably vote for moderate Democrats and Republicans (if available) on a case by case basis. 

This time, however, I’m very excited to have a moderate Democrat to vote for. I also would have voted for Mayor Pete or Klobuchar. But Joe was always my first choice and I’m glad he seems to be on track to be the nominee."
13365,"Been a Democrat my entire life.  If Biden gets the nomination I'll be staying home in November. Call me an idiot, call me angry, it doesn't matter. I couldn't care less if trump wins, it just means more of the same.  
    
But the biggest reason I won't be voting biden is to send his supporters a message. The party is changing and you were never going to win without us. Let's try this again in 4 years."
13366,"&gt;what we can’t afford is another four years of extremism whether it comes from the far right or the far left.

💯

Also, we gotta win. Someone else said this:

&gt;​It comes down to this, do you believe that the electorate is bright enough to accurately separate Democratic socialism from socialism, that the Sanders campaign will do the due diligence to truly make that distinction, and that the Trump campaign will not muddy the definition?  
&gt;  
&gt;My answer is no."
13367,"&gt; You're ignoring the fact that Progressives and Independents are two different groups, but both feel screwed over by the current political system. 

There’s nothing to suggest that independents and Progressives have the same views on what those changes should be. The circle of independents and the circle of progressives aren’t the same circle.

&gt; Voting Biden will literally result in another Trump appearing a few years down the road, while the Democrats continue to twiddle their thumbs and do fuck all.

This statement is absolutely asinine. Why do you think anyone should believe your fear mongering? 

&gt; When do my views get to matter to the Democrats?

It’s a democracy bud. We vote, the majority gets their way. If you don’t like it, find another party. Sorry, I honestly don’t know what to tell you. I am sympathetic to Bernie’s policies and voted for him in the 2016 primary. But I’m also adult enough to realize that enough people have to agree with my ideas to get them through. Quit talking like the Democratic Party is this singular entity that is supposed to adhere to your whims. The party is literally millions of people all with different leanings and ideas.

&gt; I'm not just going to sit here and spend another 20 fucking years voting blue no matter who because y'all refuse to see a bigger picture. 

Jesus Christ, the amount of preaching in this paragraph is offputting, no wonder Bernie’s supporters are doing him no favors. Ever consider that people do have the bigger picture in mind and it’s not the same picture as your’s?

&gt; Progressives supporting Blue no matter who has finally got social changes after what, 28 years, cool, gonna make me wait another 28 to get Economic change?

Be the change you want to be. Start a new party, run for office.

&gt; Also again, if Hillary hadn't have been such a terrible candidate and Obama actually appointed someone onto the Supreme Court, we would still have a Democratic Majority on the Supreme Court. 

This isn’t 2016 bud, we aren’t running Hillary. Hate to break it to you. Obama did appoint someone, the Senate didn’t approve someone. Where were you in 2016?

&gt; Simply more reasons not to support Biden from my end. I say it again, death by medical and other debt and all the other bullshit purposely stacked against us isn't particularly different from a fascist dictatorship. Death and pain remain constant through the two.

Read through Biden’s policies. You act like Biden doesn’t have policies to address this. Quit spending so much time in your little bubble and maybe read another candidate’s policy proposals instead of reading some article telling you that Biden is Satan in the flesh. You act like Biden is just some Republican yet the dude has been a Democrat for his entire career and has some really progressive policies that would completely change our current healthcare system. You may even like them. If you read them and still choose to vote Trump over Biden or sit on your butt at home, I don’t know what to tell you."

13375,"The late 60s and early 70s were the peak of the transition from ""Negro"" to ""Black"" as the preferred nomenclature.   Many older people resisted using ""Black,"" it was a reclaiming thing with younger and more radical folks.   Older people remembered ""Black"" being a slur, and people had fought long and hard to terms like ""Colored"" and ""Negro"" to be used instead.   I just spent WAY too much time searching for it (to no avail), but there was even a scene in ""The Jeffersons"" where there is an intergenerational family squabble over one older person's persistence in using ""Negro.""   Older person said something along the lines of, ""We struggled to get from N-word to Black, from Black to Colored, from Colored to Negro.   Forgive me if I can't get used to Black again just yet!""

&amp;#x200B;

The closest equivalent I can think of for younger people to consider would be how gay people see the word ""Queer"" today.   Younger LGBTQ+ folks tend to embrace it, but many over 50 have visceral memories of that word and cannot stand to hear it used/reclaimed."
13376,"The data for Hillary voters that didn’t vote for Obama is based off of one very inaccurate exit poll with a high margin of error, iirc"
13377,He never said that. He said the super delegates should back whoever won the state they represent. He even said it would go for him and for Clinton.
13378,His term ended in South Bend at the beginning of the year.
13379,Biden has a strong anti-malarkey stance. This sets him apart from the other candidates like Bernie who have yet to denounce malarkey.

13392,"The problem is that Biden and Bernie epitomize the worst that the Democrats have to offer to specific subgroups of people.  Bernie represents socialism to a country that prizes freedom and was taught to hate socialism.  Biden is the epitome of the corrupt crony capitalist establishment that the progressive faction is rebelling against.

It's hard to paint Trump as the evil one and then have your own party being 50-50 chance of being something equally as bad."

13399,"To all those suggesting Liz for VP or cabinet -- Biden supporters love Elizabeth, and the country would be lucky to have her in a key role! But let's not forget how important it is to have brilliant senators in important positions to legislate. When we flip the Senate, she could lead Banking, Housing, and Urban affairs or Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Those are going to be the roles that actually write and debate most of the legislation needed to make progress, and they are arguably more important than many cabinet posts."

13407,You believe in pandemics.
13408,His only issue is experience compared to others. That is all. He will get there. It's the same reason a AOC pick over a Harris pick wouldn't happen. Both impressive people but just not their time yet.
13409,Biden is bring out a huge number of voters. Numbers that allowed Democrats to take back the House in 2018.

13411,"She serves on the senate intelligence committee, so there will be no learning curve for her having to deal with foreign affairs."
13412,"Yep! I was (and will always be) Team Warren, but Joe will always have a big piece of my heart.

He’s a kind and decent man, even if we disagree on things. I’ll be honored to vote for him."
13413,I get the sense that the two statements from Joe on Medium last night are previews for his speech to the public early this afternoon. If so we could be in for a real treat!
13414,"She has repeatedly denied it, but she remains one of the few candidates to have not taken the Unity pledge to support the Democratic nominee."
13415,"Dont blame me for you being intellectually dishonest and not realizing that your link supported what I said. If you are afraid to address the fact that I gave you stats for jobs that we lost then that's becuase of your own issues. You cant handle facts therefore you need to turn into a full troll.

And what's your endgame here? You supported my comment, and you now have the EPIs data on jobs lost. You are afraid to admit that so you can only spam ""nah"" over and over. Do you think getting the last word will somehow hide the fact that you were wrong?"
13416,Oooh I want that flair

13418,Welcome
13419,I'm hoping for Val Demings or Stacey Abrams.

13421,"Warren fan who voted for Bernie here. Come in peace. I'm from Phoenix and I know there's no way Bernie could have won Arizona, these people are so loyal to McCain and would love to kick trump out of office, but someone that progressive could never win in Arizona. Arizona going blue let's trump hold on to Wisconsin and still lose, it would be huge."

I'm a moderate Democrat who has crossed party lines in previous elections.


Us moderate who care about character and decency need to stick together. 

Country over party forever"
13425,"Yep, I hate it but I think it's going to backfire. Joe just has to keep being the ""nice old man"" versus the assholes saying those things. It frankly comes off as bullying and I think anyone using that argument is not being very effective at swaying voters. Every voter has had a grandparent or is a grandparent. It's not a good look to be bullying."
13426,Good. We need our president to stay safe!
13427,"I think the echo chamber over there is starting to crack. It's either that non-Sanders dems are more comfortable expressing themselves than they would have been a few weeks ago on r/politics or that softer Sanders supporters are just moving on to Biden since it is pretty much inevitable. I notice a lot more posts that aren't fawning over Sanders or those talking about how unlikely it is that Sanders will be the nominee aren't downvoted into oblivion like they were. I had a post a few days ago talking about being torn between voting for Sanders when the primaries get to my state of Illinois to show that he still does have a sizable minority in the Democratic party that agree with his views and voting for Biden this doesn't drag on forever like 2016. Surprisingly I ended up with a net positive of upvotes.

One of the biggest issues from 2016 and I feel was a very fair criticism was Clinton sitting there with hundreds of superdelgates before anyone had actually voted. Going into Iowa, Clinton had something like 1/4th of all of the delegates needed to be the nominee while Sanders was sitting at maybe a few dozen. That didn't look good and that was a clear thing people could point to saying that it was rigged or that Clinton was being forced on us as the nominee. Without that issue now, most of the talk of things being ""rigged"" is much more vague and harder to come up with tangible reasons as to why that would be the case."
13428,"Wow, that sucks that they've had so little representation that she was the first..."
13429,Can you provide me with a link where he admits that he was wrong in it?
13430,"Sanders deserves respect from us, and this doesn’t look like respect."
13431,"Voting for Biden is a vote for trump. You can laugh at this now but in November if Biden goes up against trump and loses don’t be surprised. Centrist democratic candidates have never done well. So sir you SHOULD stop supporting trump. 
With that said, if its Biden vs trump i will certainly vote for biden."
13432,"I'm really worried he's going to get it and won't come back from it.  Like fate just screwing with us.

I mean, the Comey letter in October 2016 felt like fate screwing with us too."
13433,"The fact that Russia wants Bernie to win just proves why he shouldn’t. Sure to Sanders supporters he represents change, but to Russia he represents 4 more years of a polarizing president that is going to alienate half the country."
13434,I remember that. I teared up when he comforted her.
13435,Nothing he does will be good enough for the sanders supporters. This is the second election that they’re trying to sabotage out of spite. We can’t keep catering to a fringe group of whiners who can’t do math. The right did that and look what happened.
13436,Articles have been getting floated around here showing that VP pick doesn’t usually deliver an electoral victory in their state

13439,I might have to hijack your definition of establishment for the future use against Berniebros. Well said.
13440,"You point out that Obama went in aiming for universal healthcare and we ended up with ACA. So if we started to the left and compromised down, why does it make sense to start at the compromised point? Won't his positions (we're just going to have to disagree on whether they are or aren't progressive enough) just be compromised like Obama's were?"
13441,"Meh, it's whatever, just another debate that's not going to really change the numbers. It might him trying 2 pull a quick one, but that's a low percent. More like trying him hoping for a moment of perhaps his attempt to force his diehards to listen about Joe and his policies.

Could be anything really."
13442,Yea there’s a lot of malarkey there
13443,"Maybe it's because of her reputation of being mean to staff? While she's competent, if the staff thing is true, that's not someone we should have potentially leading this country."
13444,"I do hope you are this diligent in your policing of the tones of other Sanders supporters, for example the ones pushing the lie that Joe Biden has dementia."

13447,"I am opposed to single payer healthcare, i support the use of nuclear power, and in general i am weary of large government programs or nationalizing entire sectors. 

I think anyone who wins fairly, that is to say at least a plurality of delegates and votes, will be able to unite the party when it comes down to a binary vs trump."
13448,"Oh, when Biden started winning, huh?

Not, you know, when he was named Vice President for eight years?

Yeah okay."
13449,"Mississippi provided Hillary with her largest marginal win in 2016, partly because of her huge black support. I expect Biden to trounce Bernie on Tuesday too."
13450,Yeah I guess Castro is not cool to Floridians after all.
13451,"So Joe isnt that bad as Sander voters say.I have one more question,what do you think about him having really short speeches and ""sings of dementia"",especially some things he said like about poor kids just as bright as white"
13452,"Take some time to watch or listen to this speech. I think it really shows what he’s all about.

Edit 1: Including comments from AnalyticalAlpaca at end

Let's  look at the hard numbers. I  have posted below a link to ""govtracker""  that goes over the voting  history of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

GovTrack: [Bernie](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357)

GovTrack: [Biden](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joseph_biden/300008)

Based on the numbers Biden has been a primary sponsor on 42 pieces of   legislation that have been passed. Bernie has been a primary sponsor on   7. This alone should give you an idea of who is better at the politics   of getting Washington to move. Now, let's break this down into some  more  specifics. Based on this link ([https://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislative-landmarks](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislative-landmarks))   posted by helo323 we can perform a more detailed analysis of what   Bernie Sanders and his staff consider to be his legislative   accomplishments.

If you do a  simple ctrl+F command and search for ""vote"" and highlight all you see   that most of the terms related to ""vote"" or ""voted"" are ""voted against""   or ""voted no."" The legislation that Mr. Sander's has authored or passed   includes:

Proposed

* Break up too big to fail banks (didn't pass)
* Proposed a progressive tax law (didn't pass)

Amendments

* Fed audit [(GAO-11-696)](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf)  (passed)
* Medicare expansion  ([S.Amdt.2837 to S.Amdt.2786](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/111th-congress/senate-amendment/2837?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SA+2837%22%5D%7D))  (didn't pass)
* Pension and age discrimination re IBM (passed)
* Amendment re Citizens United (didn't pass)

Legislation that Sander's has voted ""no"" or ""against"" on

* War in Iraq (wise)
* First Gulf War (we weren't supposed to keep Kuwait from being treated like the Kurds?)
* Patriot Act (makes sense)
* Wall street de-regulation (reasonable)
* Voted against tax cuts (again, makes sense since the 2003 cuts were aimed at the wealthy)
* Voted against NAFTA (in line with platform)
* Voted against keystone XL
* Voted against law which didn't provide benefit equality for same-sex marriages in 1996

Based   on this article none of these are major accomplishments legislatively.   These are all fairly boiler plate and the stuff that he authored which   did pass didn't require any form of bipartisan support because they  were  widely popular pieces of legislation anyway. None of these pieces  of  legislation required any form of coalition building which sort of  proves  detractors point that Bernie is bad at actually passing  legislation.

AnalyticalAlpaca:

Statistically he is one of the least effective Senators.  [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard\_sanders/400357/report-card/2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357/report-card/2019)

* Got their bills out of committee the least often compared to Serving 10+ Years
* Got bipartisan cosponsors on the fewest bills compared to Serving 10+ Years
* Ranked the 3rd bottom/follower compared to Serving 10+ Years
* Got influential cosponsors the 4th least often compared to Serving 10+ Years

Etc. We don't live in a bubble.

Here's an article discussing that role call amendments are largely irrelevant:

&gt;The   standard language of this type of provision goes like this: “Page X,   line X, after the dollar amount, insert “(reduced by $X)(increased by   $X).” There’s nothing binding on the agency in question to spend the   money a certain way. While ineffectual in practice, such amendments can   hold symbolic value: they allow sponsors to tout their influence on the   spending process, including in official descriptions circulated in   advance of the vote and in floor speeches and news releases.

13499,"Thoughts on your points:

1. Yes, absolutely. It's my main concern about somebody like Abrams.
2. Kind of agree; your Kamala example is on point, but drawing lots of votes across the midwest instead of in one key state alone may be good enough. The problem is just racking up votes in already blue states.
3. IDK, I may have an unpopular opinion on this, but as a woman I find the argument that we should have a woman VP as a reward kind of insulting. It's still relegating women to a lower position, and almost just reinforces the glass ceiling to me, rather than breaking it. This might just be me. 
4. Only if you can find an ally that will satisfy #1 and #2... Clyburn definitely wouldn't.
5. I agree on this one if the president is inexperienced in congress. But Joe has a long history there with lots of connections, so I don't think it's so important.
6. Critically important. It's why I think there's no chance of Warren, for example: her seat should not be considered safe, especially after her anemic showing in this primary."

It's unfortunate, you can't talk with the most visible Bernie supporters anymore because they've crossed the threshold into full Trumpster style now and say that all the media reports of Biden performing better in the debate are the result of the media hating Bernie and conspiring to stop him."
13506,"This is not being fully appreciated.  

Biden has a coalition right now than can trounce Trump in the general.  The exit polls are unequivocal.  Trump has lost white suburban woman (we used to call the ""soccer moms"").

Somebody, just give me the actual quote you’re referencing so that we can have a real discussion instead of speaking in vague references.

As of now, you’re reporting some distorted form of reality that doesn’t represent the truth. Again, I’ll ask: what should Sanders have done in that situation *if he really were innocent*? Let’s just say, for the sake of argument, that he never made any such remarks to Warren. When CNN asked him about those sexist remarks on national television, was he just supposed to say “oh yeah I made those remarks” even though he didn’t? It would’ve been better for him to pretend that he was a sexist rather than correct the lie?"

Personally I don’t think 4 years is long enough to expunge the record of a candidate who was the second in an administration which committed drone strikes against innocent people.

I understand that people see socialist as basically what Bernie is, but obviously he has many other policies which I think are better than Biden’s."

The reason why Ronald Reagan's and Obama's legacies are so positively viewed by their respective parties is because they have always been known as people's-persons.

Whether you agree with their policies or not, both Obama and Reagan have been considered like-able and personable, and at the end of the day you still have to work with your enemies to get things done."

That’s not some sinister plot though, that’s politics at its best. In a democracy you need to work with other people to build coalitions. Our entire system of government is set up that way.

When it fails, it’s largely because people find ways to cheat the system and not work with other people. That’s the real problem with money in politics and gerrymandering and disenfranchisement. What happened this weekend was democracy at its best. 

But now comes the hardest part, because Bernie (and Warren) represents a large bloc that is angry and wants change. We need them to be part of the team too. Soon will come the time to come together as the anti-Trump coalition. Let us take each other’s concerns seriously. And work together to protect the democracy we share."

Debates usually fail to move the electorate at all unless it is something like the Warren Bloomberg moment (and he did better than her in a lot of places on SuperTuesday). And have you seen Trump talk? Clinton by all metrics destroyed him as far as debates go. So much that we still remember ""Puppet, no puppet. You're the puppet.""
America is also done with his nicknames. It will just energize them more.

Biden will do much better with working class voters, especially in PA, Minnesota, Florida, TX. The black vote has come out in record numbers (even bigger than anything Bernie brought in 2016). While they don't go to rallies, they vote.

Bernie is doing worse in terms of turnout than 2016. He didn't expand his base, and young people stayed home."

For those wondering why we need to end this primary ASAP, and wondering what’s the harm in Sanders continuing the primary, hopefully this article is enough to open some eyes.


Joe is losing precious weeks to full-on make the American public see that Trump’s own policies contributed to this crisis, and he gets a free pass to bumble his way to a response and thus establish himself as a “wartime president”.


Democrats are squandering the opportunity to place some of the blame where it actually lies.  And Trump is benefiting from it.  We could honestly lose the election just because we’ve lost the narrative in the span of a few short weeks."

Grassroots aren't going to cut it. Will have wooden spears and old school bows, while they'll have properly funded troops with machine guns, tanks and planes.

We would auto lose and auto lose big.

In theory, grassroots is a soulful and wonderful college thesis or project, but in reality the grassroots would just get mowed down. It's not really fair, it that's life.

1) Unfortunately there's a sizable bloc of that older voting group that doesn't view Sanders as blue and absolutely will not vote for a ""socialist.""

2) Getting out the youth vote is hard. It hasn't transpired so far and that pessimism that is baked into young people's perceptions makes it even more difficult and unpredictable. 

Of course there are risks with Biden too based on his history, gaffes, weird treatment of women etc. and I am not inspired by him in the same way that Sanders' ideological purity inspires. But, I'm starting to think the upsides to Biden's support among the establishment, black community, suburbanite women, and the reliably voting older population would make it easier for him in the general. And I would much rather have Biden (who actually has a more liberal platform than I thought) than Trump."

13592,"It has its perks and drawbacks. Makes us totally immune to the nonsense like Trump trying to get Republicans to vote for Bernie. And it affects me personally literally not at all because I'm a lifelong Dem and I've never even considered voting for a Republican candidate so it's a total nonfactor for me. 

But it does hit A) true centrist voters and voters who don't vote straight party line, B) people like the NeverTrumpers, and C) new voters and new-to-FL voters really hard sometimes. We (politically active voters, that is) try to combat it by widely republishing the cutoff date any time it comes close, but you're never going to catch everyone. Doesn't really affect Bernie-style not-centrist independents (where they're very left or very right but just aren't Republicans/Dems) because they typically just register as whichever party they're closest to. So actual self-identified Socialists for instance are likely all/mostly registered as Democrats here, not Independent. 

So as far as primaries are concerned, independent or third party candidates basically don't exist, and independent voters have to ""officially"" be part of one party or the other or they don't get a primary ballot. When we line up to vote they check our registration to decide which ballot we're ""allowed"" to have, my ""receipt"" after they looked up my ID today literally said \[DEM\] across the top of it."

To prevent it from happening again you have to get out of the student loan business altogether. So we make state schools free, and a kid decides to go to a private school and take out debt to do it. 

What’s the plan? Are you going to make Catholic Schools free, is Texas Christian going to be free, Notre Dame? They’re not state owned schools. 

Without ceasing to issue new loans - you WILL be right back here again 

There are some people that make bad decisions. 

https://www.thesimpledollar.com/loans/student/college-students-are-using-student-loan-money-to-buy-bitcoin-tuition-is-a-better-investment/

Which is why we as a party supported refinancing these loans in 2016,  the same way we did with housing.

Nobody has mentioned anything about ending the student loan program, and that’s what needs to happen if you even entertain forgiving loans"

13665,"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/factchecking-the-march-democratic-debate/

&gt; Biden denied Sanders’ claim that he ever talked on the Senate floor “about the necessity” of “cutting Social Security.” In 1984, Biden called for a one-year spending freeze that would have included Social Security, and he boasted about that position from the Senate floor in 1995. But Sanders went too far in claiming Biden has a history of “advocat[ing]” for such cuts.

&gt; ...  Biden said Sanders has “nine super PACs” and Sanders said, “I don’t have any.” Sanders may not have nine super PACs supporting his campaign, but he has some."
13666,it's good you stopped calling. Joe biden wants to cut social security and wanted the Iraq war. He is a pathetic candidate and most people don't want to get random calls from a supporter of his. It's not to late to join the sanders train.  You won't  be hated if you make calls for Bernie.
13667,This is John Delaney erasure
13668,Well Joe’s got at least two more votes that I’m sure haven’t been counted! We voted today around 5:45 p.m.
13669,"This is kind of a BS reply. Gotta be honest. As a new member of #TeamJoe coming over from #TeamPete, I'm a little unsure of some of these tweets from Biden's staffers. It's just such a different tone and approach from what I'm used to."

13674,"Right. Colorado only has 83% reporting to news organizations right now. Not sure if county clerks are just slow or if things just aren't being updated due to coronavirus. But Colorado has 7. Tennessee, who knows. Illinois just voted last week, so that's pretty normal."

13676,"This is what Dems always say. 

We need the Senate. Assuming that Republicans will give it to us is naive and dangerous.

The GOP will be able to nominate at least 2 Supreme Court justices and hundreds of other judges if they win the Senate again.

It's been almost 10 years since the Dems controlled the Senate. We need to stop losing winnable seats by being overconfident."
13677,"Those were the days, but not just for Diamond Joe. 

I wouldn’t have voted for a Romney Ryan presidency, but it would not have felt like the end of the world. 

Remember when Paul Ryan was that guy that you disagreed with, but you felt like he had principles and some kind of coherent political philosophy? Sure, he later ended his career as Trump’s errand boy, but he was okay for a minute there. 

Romney’s big gaffe during the campaign was saying that he had “binders full of women.”  And you know, maybe he should not have gotten so much shit for that.  He was basically saying that he was poised to fill leadership positions with qualified women.  He said it in an in-artful way, but the sentiment was good. 

Now we have a pussy grabber president who makes fun of disabled people."
13678,"Yeah and it doesn't know about the extent of the wins in VA and NC, along with new Florida polling that suggests a strong chance of a Biden landslide.

I think Nate's model probably spit out a crazy low Sanders win probability (under 0.5%) which is why he's being extra slow &amp; careful to release it. It's the responsible thing to do, you should be extra careful before declaring a race effectively over."

13690,"Ok berner,

But for real, Id first ask why they think Bernie actually represents working class americans. His policy isnt all that different that Bidens, though it is more protectionist, which is pro union but not pro working class. He has vilified the successes of many working class americans (millionaires and billionaires), no im not saying billionaires are working class, but millionaires make up a large percentage of americans and they come from all walks of life, many succeded in the american dream of the American Worker and should be proud of that. Bernie has passed barely any legislation that he has sponsored. So yeah."
13691,Governor defies the courts and cancels election anyway so despite the judge being a hero DeWine is being a swine
13692,"We actually only have to win four seats to take control if Doug Jones loses.  That will lead to a 50-50 tie in the Senate and then Biden’s VP will be the tie-breaker who determines who gets control of the Senate.


The last time this happened was after the 2000 election.  The November election produced an exact 50-50 tie and the Senators took their seats on January 3rd.  Al Gore was outgoing VP so he voted to give the Democrats the chamber.  Twenty days later, Dick Cheney took over and it went to the Republicans.


It’s not the best scenario, but Mitch has already basically nuked the filibuster for judicial appointments, so we could probably survive on it.  And push other major legislation through with reconciliation."
13693,"i think they’re estimating that 20-40% of california voted early? hard to tell because so many rules changed. and no, votes won’t get converted to anything. if people haven’t turned in their ballot they can vote in person, but otherwise they are out of luck. it’s interesting because they massively bumped up the primary date to fix the issue of california not having much of an effect in primaries, and now have run into the issue of what happens when you vote too early: some votes don’t count anymore."
13694,"You're so right establishment Democrats should take all the corporate money they can that will solve everything! And no not every Democrat wants finance reform a lot of them are making a lot of dirty money and they don't want it to change. 
But hey if being a loyal bootlicker makes you so happy, enjoy being a bootlicker."
13695,"I like Biden, but I'm more iffy on Pete because of his corporate funding. I feel like Pete was basically bought out. That's why I like that Biden is against unlimited campaign finances. Democracy dollars would really help out there. Pete also has to take responsibility for how he's managed as mayor of his city when it comes to racial disparity.

I also don't like that he is not really for UBI.

There were questions asking him at town halls and he just brushed it off.

A means tested UBI is just BI without the U.

I did warm up to Pete in the beginning as a second choice, but eventually wrote him off because some of his stances changed and I believe it has to do with funding behind closed doors.

The reason why I want Andrew Yang is because potentially, he can end the civil war between Democratics and Republicans while also introducing a way for multi-parties to rise up. I believe this 2 party system ring-around-a-rosy has been really unhealthy for us because it's always 2 steps forward 1 step back. This is why I understand the reasoning for why Trump got voted into office because people were tired and wanted an outsider, except Trump is the polar opposite of Andrew Yang when it comes to being an outsider.

As a techie, I really want someone who understands modern technology. I also want free basic internet rights and data rights as well.

I also don't like how Comcast owns MSNBC. The CNN debates have been so far the best out of all the networks imo because they are more fair. The debate needs to be in a longer format and not a reality tv show.

I hope we can also break Comcast's monopoly as well when it comes to internet infrastructure otherwise we're not going to be able to catch up to other countries in terms of data speeds. I say this while using Xfinity myself because sadly, it is the best in my area."

13711,"are you relying on this poll? it has Angela Merkel as #2 and the Clinton's as #3 and #4. If that doesn't demonstrate how out of date that poll is then I don't know what to tell you. (If you don't know, those are 3 of the most hated politicians in the UK, absolutely not the most beloved lol). Obama isn't particularly loved in the UK, for all the reasons i've told you, but if you think that googling it is going to tell you what you want to hear, then fine. In addition, I don't see Biden anywhere on this list, and yet Erdogan, MBS, ScoMo, Pence, Berlusconi (LOL!!) and so many other terrible politicians, and before you discredit this poll in particular, yougov is, as the name suggests, a government funded poll, similar to Gallup. Trump is #9 on this list, it's obviously wrong, and we don't hate Obama, we just don't like him, he's just another American politician that views the rest of the world as expendable.

https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/politics/popularity/foreign-politicians/all

If you think riding Obama's legacy is going to get Biden far against Trump then you're in for a rude awakening when Trump ends his career, I would suggest trying to promote Biden and get him on this list, rather than trying to discredit people who don't know much about Biden, because as i've said millions of times here, Biden gets 0 coverage abroad, we all know he was VP years ago, but from all we know, he's the old white guy who was picked to make Obama more pallatable."
13712,How do you know? Genuine question. Are there polls that say this?
13713,"He's not picking a republican, that's not a serious possibility."
13714,CNN just did too.
13715,"Longtime Biden supporters probably have a different perspective, but here’s my take on it as a recent convert (from Buttigieg):

People trust and are comfortable with Joe in a way that they aren’t with Bernie, and in times of crisis, that’s what people really want.

I have been surprised my the magnitude of the consolidation, but I suppose I really shouldn’t. Bernie’s whole approach is to sow distrust and make people uncomfortable with the status quo. So of course almost everyone outside Bernie’s base flocked to Joe.  They want more stability not less.  They don’t want to blow up the system, just get it working again.

I don’t know if ‘have a functioning administration with competent people’ and ‘be responsible’ are policies exactly, but they’re at the top of my list. Without that, you can’t get anything else."
13716,"They said they were going to use it for an ad to smear Biden. No joke, really."
13717,"I think minority voters just want a ticket that is successful and governs well.  If this means two white, male politicians or it means 2 purple, women, then so be it.  As a minority, I just want competence.  Going down the road of identity politics is one of the main reasons Hillary turned off so many people.  With that said, if we do need to pick a minority woman for some Democratic fetish desire, then an Asian/Pacific Islander woman is obviously best for the country ;-)"
13718,"It's clear and painfully obvious Tulsi and Kirsten want to be Joe's VP. For the love of any gods that possibly exist, ***don't***. IDK pick Klob or something"
13719,"Thanks for checking out the sub. This is a tiny community but its growing! 

&gt; I decided to dig a little deeper into his policy positions... but I couldn't really find anything substantive on his campaign website

I'm curious for examples of what you mean specifically w/r/t this. If you can point to some specific things you want clarified that would help since this is a really general query!"
13720,Wasn't that Mississippi?
13721,Link to article if possible?
13722,"Die hard Bernie supporter here. I came here looking for the reasons *why* people support Joe, and all I'm seeing are references to his electability. None of the memes like you see of Bernie saying meaningful things, or historically doing meaningful things. Just talk about uniting the party and how Joe can win. 

That's all he's got? No principles? No history of voting for or against things that would matter? 

Bernie is the gold standard. A genuinely altruistic person, with decades of history consistently fighting for the same things. 

If all Joe has is the fact that he was Obama's VP, that's more than a tad lame by comparison. Saying that it has to be him because ""blue no matter who"" is literally saying that you'd vote for *ANYbody* who gets the democratic nomination, completely indiscriminately, purely on the basis that the republicans are basically two-dimensional, mustache twirling villains, and even Big Bird would be preferable to them. Not because of anything you like about Joe, personally, because he apparently lacks any positive qualities beyond being a democrat. 

You can call me a petulant child all you want, I will *NOT* vote for someone with no redeeming qualities beyond his party affiliation. That's stupid. 

He's repeatedly proven himself to be racist, he wants to cut social security, and he's funded by and therefore beholden to billionaires. He's just as bad as Trump, except that he calls himself a democrat. Assuming that he'd appoint decent human beings to be judges is a big stretch. 

I won't be going to the polls in November, and no matter how angry that makes anyone, I won't be alone. Bernie is a good person. His track record is incredible. He's truly all about the people. 

We will not vote for a sack of crap wrapped in shiny paper when we could've had a legitimately compassionate leader."
13723,I believe in democracy. Biden has the votes.
13724,I bet that place smells so much better than a trump rally.
13725,He's the only one who's in it that can win it. They'd be endorsing Sanders if it was him
13726,I'm with you. I'm just worried that team Biden doesn't see it our way which is why I was wondering if we could get her named mentioned in Biden circles.
13727,"Funny that the billionaire narrative is still going even after he won states where he didn't spend a dime.

Voters for Joe."
13728,"The notion that Bernie is electable is questionable at best. The notion that Bernie could help flip the Senate and hold the House is completely false. [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21152538/bernie-sanders-electability-president-moderates-data](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21152538/bernie-sanders-electability-president-moderates-data)  


A massive survey study from political scientists at Yale and Berkeley suggests that any youth surge Bernie gets will be minor compared to the number of moderates he disenfranchises. A lot of moderates will either not vote at all or vote Republican if their choice is Sanders vs. Trump. It is very likely that we would lose the House with Sanders as our nominee."
13729,Pretty sad Bernie supporters are celebrating delays.
13730,He should have done this a week ago if he was going to do it. There is no excuse for cancelling the election the night before.
13731,"For real. I just assumed secret service had been covering them when it was down to 2 or 3. Especially Biden, he was VP. Presidents get covered their whole life. Sickening to think about in the case of Trump."
13732,So was Ohio actually cancelled? I thought I read that a judge said the election had to go on.
13733,"Bernie has a choice. Will he make a stance and defy his critics and will drop out for the sake of party unity to defeat Trump. Or he will be petty and selfish, continue to run out of spite against the ""establishment"".

This is the legacy Bernie has to choose.

I personally think he will try to hold until the debate, to have the last word with Biden on public floor one-on-one. Only then he might drop out."
13734,"Interesting. Didn't know the endorsement video got lots of buzz. Maybe that enthusiasm will add to her chances.

I'm thinking either Klobuchar or Gretchen Whitmer, probably Klobuchar. Biden has already proven he can secure black voters on his own, so Kamala doesn't add much to his appeal--especially since she's from Cali. Klobuchar would appeal to disaffected conservative-leaning women and would help to secure the midwestern states that were dependably blue before 2016. A black person in the VP spot will be a, if even subconscious, turnoff to any conservatives looking for an alternative, and who may still vote for Trump if they aren't won over."
13735,"How did this post get to number 2 on my front page?  Also Shokin the prosecutor that was fired was corrupt AF, and our European allies and Republicans in congress were in agreement with the pressure to push him out.  I'm a Bernie person, but just confused by the post.  Perhaps just a taste of what's to come in the general election."
13736,"Exactly. I tweeted in support of Biden last night, woke up this morning to dozens of mentions and tweets calling me out as a republican. They also name checked Obama as a republican. 

If you ever want me to vote blue no matter who, this kind of behavior and vicious calling out of people for different views has to STOP."
13737,#Woo Hoo!
13738,People that weren't around then have no idea how bad it was. Blood and Crips on the news every night and it primarily  in minority neighborhoods.
13739,"no, bernie swings trump voters."
13740,I'm with Biden now!
13741,He's aligning with the apparent winner of the democratic primaries.
13742,I think the mods were more vigilant before -- they are probably tired of waiting for Bernie to call it already so they can mentally move on to the general. LIKE ALL OF US.
13743,I’d be more than happy to welcome them here. Voting for the nominee sounds better than voting for Trump or not voting at all!
13744,"&gt;The ~5% of America that gives enough of a shit that Biden got the number wrong are all gun nuts who were voting GOP anyways. No one else cares.

I mean, AR-15 is a buzzword that most Americans know. Maybe only the gun nuts know what it really means, but most liberal, non-gun owners know the term ""AR-15."""

It's always a conspiracy."

13759,Was Biden the one back in the day who told rally attendees off for booing a protester?
13760,"&gt;Bill Gates: “There really is no middle ground, and it’s very tough to say to people, ‘Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner. We want you to keep spending because there’s maybe a politician who thinks GDP growth is all that counts,’” Gates said in an interview with TED Tuesday. “It’s very irresponsible for somebody to suggest that we can have the best of both worlds.”

13761,Their second edit tripped the AutoMod.   They also used that same edit to kind of troll Sanders supporters.   If they edit that part out a bit I could approve it.
13762,Nice.
13763,Laura Kelly in Kansas is similar.  But I’d so much rather have her than Brownback.

13766,wait really?
13767,"My campus is pretty apolitical outside of loving Sanders, but, I'll be doing some (friendly) Joe promotion as well. 

Can't wait for what names I'll be called."
13768,"There's been several polls today that found about 90% of Sanders voters would go for Biden, you're worrying about a minority of a minority."
13769,"Hah, I was 17, and I don’t even know who Mike Gravel is.  But we all have our silly childhood election opinions.  I liked Howard Dean for his scream, but I was 12."
13770,Millennial for Biden here...good on you for voting!
13771,"I'm not trying to build a coalition, I couldn't care less. I'm Australian and have no vested interest in this, but I do see it objectively. I'm not blinded by cult hivemind think like you are.

Tell me, what lie did i tell? Why didn't you address any of my points and say nothing of substance?

You'll wake up soon enough. Stay out of politics for a bit, your brain needs to heal."
13772,"&gt;""While it's important to note that more than 516,000 Democratic primary ballots had been cast before the poll was fielded, 

You're killing me. I hope they fix this for future primaries. So many people will have wasted their votes on a candidate who dropped out.

1.1 million votes were cast in the 2016 Dem primary. So could be nearly half voted before the Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Steyer withdrawals."
13773,"We’ll see. I’m not trying to be rude, but it sounds like he has early onset dementia. My grandpa is going through it right now and the patterns/slip ups and loss of train of thought are exactly the same."
13774,politically that wouldnt be a good idea as many democrats dont support bloomberg and almost all Republicans dont either. Even after the primaries there is still an election to win.
13775,"Why in the world would a leftward turn help in the general when it did absolutely nothing in the ""far more liberal than the general"" primaries?

If anything, Joe is going to be hurt by being too progressive."
13776,I love seeing my state show how blue it can be! I live in the DC suburbs and trump is largely hated around here.

Germany closed their nuclear power plants a few years ago. Their carbon dioxide emissions went up, and their price of energy went up. 

Fuck that, we should be building new nuclear plants, not closing them down."
13784,it's illegal in a lot of places it's to dissuade people from vote-buying.
13785,"The fact that he believes an ar15 to be a weapon of war makes it clear enough that he has no clue what he's talking about. And of all people, this is the guy Joe would like to decide on gun policy? Surely we are full of shit if we might suggest this might indeed be a 2A issue."

13792,"It's beyond hypocrisy for progressives to vote for anyone besides Biden. Deciding not to vote is a vote for Trump as well. If Bernie fans (me being one) care about women's reproductive health, trans rights, equality, etc we need to vote for Biden"
13793,"The tweet below sums it up. They should be held accountable for predicting such a low probability of him winning Minnesota and Massachusetts. I'm not saying their statistical analysis was wrong based on the data available, but that the analysis they did turned out to be useless. Events like this seems to validate Nasim Taleb's attacks on them..

13794,AMAZING endorsement.
13795,"Bernie should have dropped out and this would be easy now. 

He has no path to victory and now he’s going to expose people to a virus to keep him out of office"
13796,"Historical context exists, and people change, regardless of how snarky you are about it. I could easily bring up Bernie's nonexistent legislative history, or how he spoke out against Obamacare itself in '09 for being too market oriented (providing Republicans in the Senate plenty of sound bites) while Joe got it passed. 

Regardless, comparing the two candidate's current policy proposals, Joe is orders of magnitude more in line with basic economic principles on almost every issue, from tax code to housing to climate change."
13797,"They also accuse them of being conservative and voting for him because he was Obama's VP.  Maybe Sanders, after losing the South and African American voters in 2016, should have toured the area reaching out and listening.  Maybe he should have reached out to Clyburn, even if they don't see eye to eye on everything.  I want a President who can a diverse coalition, even with people they may have disagreements with."
13798,this coronavirus thing has me spooked man. If the economy keeps tanking this hard and a bunch of people just can't get any food or water or pay their bills after a certain period of time.... I'm not going to finish that thought
13799,"Exit Polling has Clinton voters support of Obama in 2008 at 84%.

[https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/exit.polls/](https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/exit.polls/)

Meanwhile, Sanders voters support of Clinton in 2016 was 74.3%.

While these sources do show that only 12% of Sanders supporters voted Trump, compared to 15% of Clinton supporters voted McCain, it is absolutely not correct to say that more Bernie supporters went for Hillary then Hillary's went for Obama."
13800,I really hope this sub doesn’t go negative like the Bernie subs.
13801,My heart stops for a second every time I see her name in a headline.
13802,"Absolutely. Joe wasn’t my first choice, but he knows what Americans want, and he’s got a heart of gold. 

Also, it was very heartening for me to see how many of us Pete supporters were willing to do the pragmatic thing and just instantly integrate ourselves with the welcoming people over here on the Biden side."
13803,Firewall!
13804,Welcome aboard. You don't have to stop loving Bernie to vote for Joe.
13805,"It's weird, but I always thought that countries could try to copy policies that worked in other countries before trying to invent their own solutions. In my head, I'm just comparing our issues with how I was stuck on a programming problem at work and the boss told me to just google the solution instead of trying to reinvent the wheel."
13806,"Each one of them was a heavily flawed candidate supporting an even more flawed candidate. (Yes I know I'm saying this on a Biden subreddit, and yes I'm ok with the downvotes.)"
13807,"Here is what we are voting for.  This map shows counties with life expectancy over 80 years old, in green.

13808,"Re-electing a president is a lot easier then breaking them into the national stage. We are trying to defeat an incumbent, and her work on a candidate who did not have the benefits of being the incumbent, and how poorly that went, is not good. There’s so much campaign talent out there that is a lot better. Silver lining at least is that this isn’t Kamala’s campaign manager(s), but that isn’t much of an upgrade"

13811,Best ad yet!
13812,Love that guy. 🐊💎
13813,Apparently you fell asleep last week.  That's exactly what happened after South Carolina
13814,"A big difference is that people have disliked Hillary since 1992. And Joe has always been the love able politician. 
There was never anything wrong with Hillary except that people hater her. Nobody hates Joe. So if they are exactly the same... except that, then we are good"
13815,"Here’s (most of) the relevant bits; it’s about halfway through that criminal justice policy (and there’s a lot of related stuff around it, like ending the death penalty):

&gt;**End all incarceration for drug use alone and instead divert individuals to drug courts and treatment.** Biden believes that no one should be imprisoned for the use of illegal drugs alone. Instead, Biden will require federal courts to divert these individuals to drug courts so they receive treatment to address their substance use disorder. He’ll incentivize states to put the same requirements in place. And, he’ll expand funding for federal, state, and local drug courts.

&gt;**Expand other effective alternatives to detention.** The Biden Administration will also take an evidence-based approach to increase federal funding for other alternatives-to-detention courts and related programs for individuals convicted of non-violent crimes, such as veterans courts and youthful offender courts.

&gt;**Use the president’s clemency power to secure the release of individuals facing unduly long sentences for certain non-violent and drug crimes.** President Obama used his clemency power more than any of the 10 prior presidents. Biden will continue this tradition and broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes.

And his [healthcare plan is here;](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/) I wish his site had a search option, but oh well. I often have to google “joebiden.com” plus the issue when I’m looking for stuff."
13816,"I know, right? people are nuts.  

But by far the most memorable use of flight info was when 4chan used [intersecting flight patterns](https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/738828/4chan-users-find-the-secret-location-of-shia-leboufs-he-will-not-divide-us-by-using-flight-patterns-and-star-maps-steal-it-and-replace-it-with-a-make-america-great-again-hat) to locate shia labouf's ""he will not divide us"" protest. Peak 'tism right there."
13817,"When my candidate dropped out I was really bitter. It felt like supporters were gloating. I'm over it now, but anyone who gets in the face of someone who's candidate just dropped out and says, ""vote blue no matter who,"" while that person is still grieving deserves a nasty yeast infection.  Just my opinion.

The ones who show up here cheerfully saying, ""I used to support candidate xyz, but now I'm with you guys,"" are amazing and inspirational and much better people than I."
13818,I don't even know how to react to this.
13819,Thank you! 🙂 Both Biden and Pete are great choices and we’d be honored to have you on Team Joe if you ever decide to join us.
13820,"Whatever happened over there, it’s not cool. Hopefully they get on board when it’s Diamond Joe versus the dumpster fire come summer."
13821,Tbh I like Joe a lot but wouldn't be surprised if he died in office. He better have a good VP (looking at you mayor)
13822,"Wow, everything is coming up Biden."
13823,Joe from Scranton!
13824,"Everyone knows this already, everyone but Sanders and his supporters."
13825,Mandatory buyback is just newspeak for confiscation.
13826,Power move right there
13827,"The problem with Bernie is not that some internet randos spek in his name, is that he repeatedly condones thos toxic voices. a few examples:

\-His staffer who harassed JVN on twitter for daring support another candidate

\-people from his campaign going to chapotraphouse, which does things like tweeting a picture of a gang rape with the words ""pete's hq"" on it, cause homophobia is more acceptable if you're a left maga ig guess.

\-He has BLOODY nina turner, david sirota, and a hella lot more toxic people around his campaign. That's why it's  not some people on twitter being mean, is his campaign itself giving a plattform to these divisive people.

\- Bernie tweeting  “That wasn’t her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected as a matter of fact,"" when in the primary he stumped AGAINST her

\- Bernie tweeting a conspiracy theory about pete and klob dropping out..."
13828,"Then you agree with Joe on everything here except m4a. 

That being said m4a is pretty extreme considering there isn’t a single country close to it. Biden supports universal healthcare that is more aligned with worldwide models than Bernies plan."
13829,"We’ve got second place in Vermont and are viable?!


Holy shit...this is going to be a blood bath."
13830,Michigan.  The Great State.
13831,"How do you know that 4 more years of Trump will result in ""universal healthcare""?

You were wrong about your guy winning in 2016 and you were wrong again 2020. Maybe you'll be wrong again in 2024.

In reality, not voting for Biden when the opposition is Trump will only be ""teaching"" Democrats that Biden is too liberal. No sane person will look at a conservative like Trump being elected and say the country wants a progressive."
13832,"IF we had adequate testing, you could think about opening certain areas. But we don't and if you don't know where the virus is, you can't open things up. Plus at this point there is community spread in most areas of the country."
13833,I can see trump referring to this when he skips the debates
13834,"Except the source is NPR, not Seth Abramson.  He retweeted nprfreshair."
13835,Thanks.  We are glad to have you onboard
13836,Which of us is buying the other an ice cream?
13837,"I'd love for the WA senators to endorse him, but I'm not sure he'd preview that to his donors like that - it doesn't seem major enough? Unless it's both of them."
13838,"Why has Joe been silent during this whole national health crisis? As the democratic front runner, why isn’t he dominating the airwaves being front and center addressing his plans to deal with this?"
13839,"Have a Bernie supporter friend at school telling me today that giving people the option to opt in Medicare or keeping their private insurance is stupid, and that Medicare for all is the ONLY answer."
13840,I'm shocked. Bernard brothers were treating Warren supporters SO politely online this entire time :\^)
13841,"Whatever media you're in, mainstream media or social media, there will be a bubble. It's good to step out of them once in a while to survey the landscape. Problem with people is that they rarely diversify their perspective and so fall trap within their bubble."
13842,"As much as I have come to like Joe, I think he is a bit of both"
13843,"Yeah, this has been a slightly growing concern since ST. The media has emphasized the Joementum message, so the offline voting public are well aware of his new advantage. If it's hyped too much it may breed complacency, and I want Joe to seal the deal on Tuesday in Michigan!"
13844,"So far, it's only just the early mail-in ballots, and Bernie is only slightly leading. That's not where he wants to be."
13845,No.
13846,Bye.
13847,At least I have a lot of unplayed games on steam. Who am I kidding I'll probably just play dark souls again
13848,"My school is more conservative so it’s a weird balance of Trump supporters taking on Bernie supporters, which means there’s rarely any Joe supporters."
13849,I heard Texas is the same. It's incredibly frustrating.
13850,I've been here for a month now and your telling me we get the ice-cream too?
13851,"I was responding to your standards. I personally worry more about things like public good, and ending foreign wars, and curbing the military industrial complex. I just don't see Joe Biden standing up to big business in favor of the working class and I really feel like that is what we need right now more than a return to business as usual."
13852,"But unfortunately as Yang said on CNN, you think three things to win: 

1. Ground support and energized base
2. Earned Media
3. Paid Advertising

Bloomberg only had three. Biden on the other hand had all three. He didn't need much of paid advertising because almost everyone knows who he is. That Obama link up is enough for most people."
13853,"Ok, I was this close to taking this post seriously. Now this is clearly bait. Go back to QAnon where this type of malarkey belongs."
13854,"I think Pete or Warren would be best to make up for what Biden lacks, which is grassroots enthusiasm and organizing as well as reaching a little bit into Bernie's crowd."
13855,Lost cause unfortunately. Biden's a believer in gun control even if I disagree with him on it.
13856,"Clinton also dominated Pennsylvania (+12) and Florida (+31)

Democrats needed one of those states even if they won Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 (or both of the former without either of the latter)"
13857,I think this is the right thing to do and I'm glad the challenge has been issued.  Leaders without high office can still organize for change that saves lives.
13858,You were watching an entirely different debate than I was... Are you aware of how biased you are?
13859,Yeah remember when Bernie was bragging about cutting social security...oh wait.
13860,"This is a good point. Generally speaking, if my wife were to take any role that regulated any industry I would be expected to get rid of any stocks I had in said industry. Too bad the other responder just turned your reasonable question into a joke."
13861,Joe Biden has a history of being pragmatic and making deals with Republicans while Bernie is going to demand GOP senators bend the knee.
13862,"The stats show it's actually like 40-45 percent going to Biden. (Last I checked at least)

Sanders has a youth majority, but it's exaggerated to seems bigger then it is."
13863,Malarkey is OVER
13864,"Which is a shame, I think the last debate was one of the best."

Why would a traumatized sexual assault survivor tweet positively about her assaulter for 2+ years and then start a new twitter account with a fake name once she decided to make the allegations? And why did she shop the story to the Warren and Harris campaigns?"
13867,"Right? It helps that Warren looks quite young for her age. If I didn't know better, I'd think she was 60."
13868,"Sure, but it's not a bad faith argument at all to discuss boundaries that one tacitly endorses, which is incredibly relevant for these discussions."
13869,I was very proud of Joe's speech today
13870,"This Fox Poll found his approval rating at 48%, yet he only got 40% to Biden's 49% in a head-to-head. It seems his approval doesn't actually correlate directly to better GE poll performances."
13871,"I'm relieved to hear that. I have recently been rewatching Trump vs Hillary and i just could not see how can anyone, except for Trump supporters of course, appreciate her strong performance. She ignored Trumps BS, talked about policies, supported her claims with facts and the only moment at which she's been losing ground was the e-mail scandal, which turned out to be bs anyway but there was no way to prove that at that moment. 
My personal favorite is when Trump makes a poor joke in the middle of discussing economy, saying ""(...)when Obama leaves the office, and goes to a golf course for the rest of his life(...)"". I was watching Hillary's face at that moment to look for any reaction whatsoever. There was none. Her absolutely unphased look made his cringy joke so much worse on him.
Also, at one point she said ""i have a feeling i'm going to be blamed for everything by the end of this debate"" and he responded ""why not?"".  She made him look like a clumsy enterteiner/failed businessman and a politician-wannabe that he is, absolutely won the debate on every single level and displayed such class, such restraint, also a lot of energy and unlike Trump obeyed the debate's rules. 
I guess it didnt matter because some people would just hate her no matter what she did at this point. Thats the part ive been trying to understand for so long, always found her very likeable and relatable."
13872,300k voters in VS and 30%!!! Crushed!!!
13873,"True, which is why it needs to be an all or nothing type system. no picking and choosing what’s covered. if it’s a medical thing, it’s covered. if that’s the route we want to take"
13874,That's just an issue with plurality voting tbh
13875,"Honestly, his policies are left enough to warrant any progressive's vote who is actually having the conversation in good faith. No need to keep chasing those who refuse to be caught. 
  
I think Biden risks losing more actual voters in the center than he could gain by appealing to the **far** left."
13876,"Oh my god as a Michigander I’m so happy. Washtenaw county went for Biden, which (from personal experience) felt like a Bernie hellhole since it’s the University of Michigan campus."
13877,"Every vote counts, please vote to send a strong message. Poll in itself is nothing."
13878,"Amy, Pete, and Blomberg are overplaying their hands. They are staying in hoping that they can use whatever delegates they accumulate to stop Bernie at the convention and fall in the good graces of the next non-Sanders administration but what's likely going to happen is either

1. Sanders enters the convention with a clear plurality, and their delegates end up being useless 

2. Biden is the nominee, but none of them will have any real leverage for a cabinet/VP spot, because Biden's campaign is no longer at its most dire moment (ie: After NH, After NV).

So I guess the only opportunity any of them will have for any influence is if there is no clear plurality at the convention, but the odds of that are very low, and the odds they will have sway over who the nominee is is even more slim imo."

13911,I think you're right. Ads that paint him as a unifier.
13912,So many endorsements today. I really hope this will reflect in Super Tuesday.
13913,"I've already split that hair. Warren is the left mist end of people who think capitalism should be fixed rather than replaced with socialism. It's not just that he is an Independent, it's that their fundamental beliefs are so different that really are not part of the same party. AOC said the quiet part out loud."
13914,"This is depressing, Biden can’t beat trump. Another 4 years is what we’re getting with Biden on the nomination ticket. 

Wake up people."
13915,"Does Bernie not understand that under M4A, hospitals would be making less, and would have less incentive to get things like excess respirators?  America is leading the world per capita in ICU beds.  These things would disappear under M4A.  There’s a reason so many doctors don’t take Medicare."

13918,Iowa and Nevada were caucuses and New Hampshire was a primary so this was technically the 2nd primary but the 4th contest.
13919,"Klobuchar would be disastrous--Tim Kaine-esque pick. If you look at the numbers, Biden hasn't actually been increasing the numbers of AA voters over Hillary. Can't count on enthusiasm in the general."
13920,So before or by the weekend?
13921,I think I heard them say that Biden won every county in SC 🗳️👍
13922,"LOL that is your defense , this dude is more racist then Trump. I wish we had a good candidate"
13923,"That’s not how this works... I’m literally using the facts from his website. How can you outspend the entire budget just on healthcare? How is he planning on getting this wealth? Taxes on who will cover it? Assuming you use convert the entire current health care budget, AND the entire military budget over the next 10 years, AND add a 100% billionaire wealth tax, that’s still not enough!! Where does the rest come from??"
13924,Hahaha. The Russians are angry! They loooove Bernie.
13925,He literally seems exactly the same as he’s been the entire campaign. This is the same guy who has been quirky and out of the norm since he got into politics. You’re just poking and prodding at what isn’t actually a thing
13926,was just thrown for a damn loop by a Bloomberg for President ad before I realized I was watching a recording from last week. That didn't age well.
13927,"Fair point, although I’d argue he’s over the line on “flawed.” I just think we should double check what happened last time we choose a moderate, establishment friendly candidate with baggage."
13928,You might call it ... a revolution.
13929,"Do you really think that John Lewis and Julian Bond didn't vote? Sat out elections because LBJ or Humphrey wasn't everything they could've hoped for? There is no logic in that.

All that second paragraph is telling me is that you haven't come within five miles of poverty in your entire life. Honestly the ignorance there is unbelievable. This is why Sanders has struggled to win in impoverished communities across the United States - poor folks know when they're being talked down to or used as political pawns."
13930,"The only way to bridge the divide is for progressives to work out a longer game plan and accept that plan.

Don't play for tomorrow, play 10, 20, 50 years ahead.

Take the small victories where you can and work with the current party structure to change and influence it towards the best end.

That's how unity happens.

Now, are the progressives going to get everything they want done, done? No. Nobody does. It's a process and sometimes a long one at that.

No VP, no P, no one vote is going to massively change things."

13932,"I am an american citizen. Ever heard of dual citizenship? And even if I was not: this affects the whole world, in particular Latin America.
Clinton would have been way more imperialistic than Trump is, but having Trump or a neoliberal does not appeal to Latinos.
Hence the lack of this demographic support to Biden."
13933,I immediately have more respect of anyone who loves their pet(s). That is all.
13934,"I don’t know if it’s all Biden supporters but my mom and I hate her. She thretened to jail poor parents of truant kids. She claimed that she smoked marijuana while listening to a rap album that didn’t yet exist. Either she lied about listening to the album, lied about when she smoked, which means that she was smoking when she was already putting people in jail for marijuana possetion, or that she made the whole thing up. She hid exculpatory evidence from the defense team of a man on death row. She threatened that if congress doesn’t pass a proposal of her’s, she’ll do it by executive order, a Trump-style attack on our constitutional system of governance. It would literally be kind of hard for me to vote for Biden if she’s on the ticket, and I’m a Biden supporter. She shouldn’t be anywhere near the oval office."
13935,"Made my first donation when I saw the results in SC. I was kind of sitting on the sidelines to see how the moderate vote was gonna shake out, but now I think it's time to get behind Joe before the big states start voting. I only gave $10 so far but I'm gonna do more. Let's go Joe!"
13936,"Huge Welcome! I fully understand the desire to support Bernie. I voted for him in 2016. Not because I hated Hillary. I just wanted (naively) to send a message knowing she had won by the time I voted to listen to the youth. In this election, having seen 3 years of Trump and counting, I'm no longer in the mood to send messages. I agree very much with Bernie, but I just don't get the hate for so many of the others in the field. Reality sucks right now. We need to think very carefully about what the future of this country is going to be. This isn't a debate over tax rates. This is a debate over truth versus lies. Good versus evil. Congress and the courts will limit progress to the most incremental measures. We need someone to win that battle. As much as Bernie has good ideas, they are simply not where the country is currently. They are lofty, incredible goals. We need to shoot for them. But we also need to work together, come together, and I just feel it is appropriate at this point to make realistic short term goals. The truth is 4-8 years is short term in this battle. We will get there, but it has to be step by step, one day at a time right now. It sucks, but that is how it is."
13937,Did they do Arizona?

13940,Beto!

13942,"I don’t think Kampala’s record as a prosecutor is that much different than Amy’s. Possibly more progressive. It’s just that Bernie’s villagers saw Kamala as a bigger threat and push that from day one. The reason to pick Amy is that she probably has a pretty good match with suburban women, who were the swing voters in 2016 and 2018. I think Joe owes a tremendous amount to black voters, and would prefer he went with Kamala, Val Dennings, or Underwood from Illinois. (She’s a former nurse, and I think that would play really well right now.)"

13951,"Research has shown that college tuition itself isn't as big a problem for students as room and board and test prep. Making college more accessible to students, especially for minority students, will be far more effective. Free college is a give-away to affluent families who can probably afford college anyway."
13952,"Im all over the place right now, to be honest. I want to defeat Trump and take back control of the senate and House but I also don't want to repeat 2016 again. I'm from California so my vote for Biden isn't as imperative but I want to phonebank and canvass for Biden while also voting downticket."
13953,"While I don’t think Yang would make a good president, I think there are plenty of cabinent positions he’s suited for."
13954,I don't agree with Biden's agenda so I won't vote for him. If he was a progressive I might feel different but he was even right of Obama.
13955,"If Bernie can't excite young people, why would Biden focus on that? That just tells me they're a lost cause, so Biden would be better off focusing on improving his area on groups that don't vote over convincing non-voters to vote."
13956,"No issues with top 7 on your list though I love Amy,  I think she does not bring enough spice. And Kirsten is from NY, we should get one from a swing state, that does not put a senate seat at risk.  I like Abrams too but I do not see her as president and thus I dont think she is a good pick for VP."
13957,"We all want to do the right thing - if this allegation is true, I'm sure a lot of us will change our mind and support Bernie to represent our cause. However, I'm skeptical at this point - this woman made an allegation against Joe last April around inappropriate touching. Now she's alleging that Joe sexually assaulted her. Why not allege back in April that Joe sexually assaulted her? Not a disqualifier but does not instill any confidence that she's not a con-artist."

13964,"I had been leaning towards Sanders since January until recently, after Super Tuesday, and in that time I found a lot of similarities to the 2016 Trump campaign. The difference is that Sanders has (mostly) better policies, is a decent human being, and is not a demagogue, but his campaign on the ground and online has produced a scorched earth method that Trump ran in 2016, which creates a horrible socio-political environment that I want nothing to do with. The attitude of ""if you're not with me, you're against me,"" all news is fake except for a bunch of nobodies that I follow on social media, and so on. I don't believe Sanders is intentionally responsible for much of it, but it doesn't matter at this point."
13965,"It amazes me how strong they're pushing propaganda against Joe. It's ""Hillary is on her death bed with pneumonia"" levels of crazy"
13966,Welcome!
13967,"So let’s look at the record,

Opposed busing (which historically wasn’t a great policy anyways

Has the endorsement of literally the entire black congressional caucus

Chosen by Obama to be VP twice

Give the medal of freedom by the national civil rights museum

Has overwhelming black support

You think this guy is a segregationist?"
13968,This is peak dad mode.
13969,"Yeah ik, it’s more likely that Biden will win, unless he has a horrible debate performance Sunday."
13970,Thanks!
13971,Governor Cuomo just announced the NY primary is being delayed. New date is June 23rd. You know what that means. Bernie is going to stay in the race all the way until the DNC convention.
13972,Still crying that your socialist didn’t win? Lmao
13973,"Early voting is a major part of these primaries. At 11% results in Florida over 120,000 votes are for Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Warren, and Klobuchar, so just imagine how many early votes Joe got. Hell, Florida just got called for him as I checked those numbers."
13974,I remember that debate actually! Its around when I first started to like Joe. I really appreciate the explanations by some (the hostilities of others haven't been too nice in some comments). I think moving forward with the knowledge I have now of it makes me view him in a better like and in thankful for it.
13975,"it's so funny that this was a ""gaffe"" 

a few more gaffes like this could make the country a better place for everyone"
13976,NO MALARKEY ZONE!
13977,"No talking about VP till after the primary.

We need time to come together, not fighting each other.

Please and thank you."
13978,"Can anyone explain briefly on Biden's appeal to me? Guy seems to have dementia and his policies go the Hillary 2016 route, basically a nudge on the status quo. I'm a Warren or Sanders guy."
13979,Yeah I’m watching that now. This week is so crazy I think I have whiplash.
13980,says the bot account that is actively trying to divide supporters of the greatest democratic candidate to date. I see through your guise u/soloon
13981,"""The running for senate"" thing is another example of how Biden's shit gets taken wildly out of context, and unfortunately a lot of blue check journalists spread it. For years, he's finished many of his speeches by circling back to his initial campaign and he says something like ""back then, I used to go ""I'm Joe Biden running for Senate"" and all this time later I'm going asking you to support me again""... Even on this campaign, he's finished a ton of speeches by going ""I used to say I'm Joe Biden running for senate, and I'm asking you to trust me and elect me as President"" or something roughly along those lines. 

Like there are videos of him doing this, and even other journalists who covered him pointed it out when the clip was going around...What happened was he was rushing through his speech and he basically didn't finish his spiel that he's said a million times before....it's a schitck he was literally doing a month ago, too. 

Joe absolutely has tons of gaffes...a lot is due to his speech impediment...and it absolutely is a bit worse during debates (the pressure and yeah, his age contribute to it).  But the clips are insanely misleading 95% of the time....taken out of context, like I explained above, or even edited....and it is so frustrating that journalists are playing into it. It's ""but her emails"" again. 

Yair Rosenberg calls it out fairly frequently...I've seen some Politico journalists (of all people, since they are usually terrible) call it out, too. But...it's bad. And I'm sincerely frustrated that a lot of Bernie people are contributing to it."
13982,"Really hoping coronavirus doesn't mess with turnout or skew results too much. Any race even moderately close will be used as a justification to keep the primary going, when it should have been over last Wednesday to focus all attention on the GE."
13983,"Remember Romney saying Russia was a major security threat and everyone laughed at him?

Yeah, I feel like he was the last of the decent Republicans. I wouldn't vote for him anymore but I hope when the GOP disintegrates he can lead a new less even center right party."
13984,"He was the top private jet user in the campaign.  He even once got on the wrong one.

https://www.tmz.com/2020/02/29/bernie-sanders-boards-wrong-gulfstream-private-jet-campaign/

&gt; Some have criticized Sanders for flying private at all -- seeing how he rails against billionaires and elites. In fact, earlier this month ... he was spotted boarding a private aircraft while Liz Warren got on her own jet as they both flew back to D.C. from different locations just 36 minutes apart. The implication ... they coulda flown together, spared the air, etc."
13985,No and yes
13986,"Bernie basically throw away Florida, and really alienated parts of Pennsylvania. don't get me wrong I'd vote for Bernie if he somehow was the nom. But I much prefer Biden."
13987,"I agree. It gets to the point where some people seem to just really want to feel relevant. They think they can hold the election hostage because their candidate didn't win the nomination. I'm getting whiplash watching the transitions from ""basic rights for everyone"" to ""fuck poor people and women"". Maybe part of the reason the movement isn't catching momentum is that they do a ideological 180 whenever they're questioned? (And by ""they"" I mean the entitled white males, I know the majority of Bernie supporters are NOT like that)"
13988,There are lots of endorsements this morning.
13989,"Yup... Joe has his good and bad points, but he's as genuine as they come, and that's amazingly refreshing after several years of insane lizard-beings being in power."
13990,I like that he's supporting Bobby Scott's SAFE act
13991,Completely agree. If anything it emboldens sanders supporters against Biden.
13992,That will never happen with the checks and balances we have in place
13993,Agreed. I just hate that Bernie is still taking people's money when there is no path to victory. It's a pretty shitty thing.
13994,"Good guy, just needs some experience. No doubt he would be welcome in a Biden administration."

He said he spends up to seven hours a day on the phone — talking with governors, senators, House members, mayors, policy experts and hospital officials. And of course he talks to his own policy and political staffs, who also are mostly working from home, spread along the Eastern Seaboard.

&gt; When people come to meet with him in Wilmington, Biden said, some wear masks and gloves. ""We're following the CDC guidelines,"" he said.

&gt; He insisted that he is thinking only about the coronavirus crisis, not the unfinished business of his primary fight with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""That's been my overwhelming focus and haven't thought much beyond that,"" he said. ""You know, dealing with immediate urgency."""
14001,Yeah and unfortunately a lot of his donations are coming out of the pockets of young adults and college kids who already strapped for cash. I commend them for participating in the system but it’s a shame that it’s more or less a waste.

So much better than Trump is literally just having basic fucking competence, you could literally pull up some fucking 15 year old and they would be better than Trump.

Healthcare falls within provincial jurisdiction, and therefore it's up to the provincial governments to ensure that these private clinics are not breaking the CHA. The problem is that many clinics do, and some provinces let them push the boundaries. The federal government can then put pressure on the provinces in several ways, namely by fining them or, ultimately, threatening to cut transfer payments.

Scott Brown winning the seat was because of two main factors: Mass citizens being generally cordial to the GOP pre-Trump and the Dems stupidly assuming that they'd win a Senatorial election without campaigning (Seriously, a lot of people didn't even know who the Dem canidate *was*. I can't even remember who it is now).

The former no longer exists because Trump's killed a lot of the GOP's good will in the state. Baker won *in spite* of his party affiliation at this point, not because of it. The latter is a risk that I'd hope the DNC learned from so they don't repeat history.

TLDR, it's not a 'lock' but it's overwhelmingly more than likely."

14023,"If you say so. That sounds awfully black and white to me. Presenting speculation about a back room deal *as* speculation is definitely not conspiracy, but a hypothesis.

&gt;Anyone who knows Joe Biden knows he leads with his heart.

&gt;He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win.

&gt;That is why today I’m excited to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. He is the best choice for a gun safety president.

&gt;After I was shot, Joe was there for me. As I worked to recover and resume my public service, he was there for me then, too.

&gt;As we’ve built a gun safety movement and campaigned to pass safer gun laws across America, Joe has been there with us.

&gt;And as President, I know he will stand with the millions of Americans committed to fighting for gun safety.

&gt;Joe Biden is the gun safety president we need in the White House. If you are with us, will you show your support today?

&gt;We can trust Joe Biden to face Donald Trump and the NRA head on and win.

&gt;We can trust him to build a nationwide movement that brings gun safety to the forefront and save lives.

&gt;And we can trust him to make our communities and our families safer from gun violence.

&gt;Now we just need to get out there and work our hardest to make sure he wins in November. I’m fired up and I hope you are too!

14035,"First gubernatorial race I ever voted in was his re election, I was 21.  Never really hear his name but I saw him speak several times as a young democrat and liked him a lot."

14037,"Warren Democrat here, I literally have spreadsheets when it comes to choosing candidates (that are not Warren, who I will never be rational about)"
14038,"The reason being coal isn't s focused is because a lot of times they are becoming economically unfeasible. There are quiet a few that are getting old and the cost of fixing them aren't worth it. I personally believe that when Al Gore had the presidency stolen from him then we could of used natural gas as a transition fuel. I just think at the current state of the climate we have to do something that isn't as good for the economy. I do agree with your point on Bernie's nuclear consumption, but I think thats counteracted by how much spending he has allocated on investing on renewable energy.  I personally haven't meet anyone who thinks that Joe Biden is a climate denier, but everyone thinks he doesn't go far enough. Even Jay Inslee said that in a debate and he has been a leader in climate policy for multiple decades. His policies are good I just think they could be a bit better."
14039,"Usually, though we've had a Green party mayor here and a state house rep. They actually tried to make a go from the bottom up in Arkansas."
14040,But idk. Feel like that wont happen
14041,I'm sure there were many Democrats in those states that weren't Bernie supporters that also didn't vote for Hillary. The turn out compared to Obama was dismal. You can't blame Bernie for Hillary not being a strong enough candidate to sway voters and voters not just falling behind her just because she won the nom. Especially when you consider that many Bernie supporters are younger and didn't necessarily have a strong affiliation with the Democratic Party.
14042,My favorite part
14043,"My parents (who are Democrats) and live in Florida feel the same way. I remember having pretty long discussions trying to convince my mom that she should vote for Warren if she won the nomination.  I never really tried to make the same case for Sanders because it seemed hopeless. If he gets the nomination, I’d give it a shot, but neither needs convincing to vote for Joe."
14044,🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎 it’s always been a positive and peaceful place. Adopting the Buttigieg ROTR was another step in making this place that much calmer.
14045,"Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign manager, has subtly encouraged it. Check out her tweets before Pete dropped out..."
14046,I. Love. This. Meme.
14047,Beats investing in Sanders market!
14048,Nothing has ever equaled 0% more than this

Why?"
14050,"Heck, most of them probably live in deep blue states anyway"
14051,"not entirely but it's a  point in favor no matter how small.
winning trump voters and berine bros ag the same time is well was the main reason i supported andrew  for VP.

now that it's for sure  going to be a woman i think one of the governors  listed above would make the best choice ."
14052,"His executive assistant from when he was a senator (who is a woman although not sure it should matter), Marianne Baker, has denied that this occurred or that there were any complaints about his conduct. Reade claims that she complained about it and eventually lost her job due to this.

Also, the accuser has an old Twitter account praising Biden for years until he entered the presidential race last year.

14053,"I can't imagine Joe Biden ever referring to receiving the Eucharist as ""I take the little cracker"", so there's that."
14054,Welcome. Time for all people of good will to join together to end Trumpism
14055,Thanks!
14056,"To be fair, has he answered anything tonight? All I’ve heard was his stump speech over and over rephrased."
14057,I secretly wanted Warren/Pete
14058,He should attack Trump or his personal failings and corruption and criminalities when he talks shit about Joe.
14059,"Have you seen the video where Trump says Bernie would've been tougher to run against than Hillary? At the end his staff laughs at the idea of Biden running. One even says ""I hope Biden runs."""
14060,"I believe that the Mueller report showed the lengths the Russians went to interfere in 2016 and here’s a reminder for those who’ve forgotten. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_Report#Russian_interference

I also believe Bernie Sanders when he tells us that he’s aware that Russia is trying to help him. 

I also believe that this woman has become an agent of Putin and that this interview today on The Hill will ignore all of these factors and go pure leftist Fox News. Thankfully nobody outside of the Bernie bubble watches Hill rising or TYT so I also believe that none of this will slow Joementum."
14061,"Come on. You just didn’t like her. Didn’t matter what she said, you wouldn’t’ve bought it. She grew up middle-class, and she and Bill worked very hard, he grew up poor and then middle-class himself. These were not folks who came from Rockefeller type wealth, though they did earn it, mostly through books they sold. Why did those books sell?, Because people liked them and appreciated their service to the country.

It’s also a myth that she didn’t visit the swing states. She was in Michigan the weekend before the election, so is Barack Obama.  They were both at a rally in Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, the other key swing state, with their spouses and families, the night before Election Day .She didn’t go to Wisconsin, because the polls showed her with a six point ahead, and she was therefore visiting closer states trying to win them. 

James Comey sticking his nose in the whole thing in the last couple of weeks screwed everything up. It threw off the polls. When he exonerated her two days before the election, that actually hurt her. It reminded people of the whole thing. That is all reflected in publicly available poll data, not something I made up. I worked on the campaign.

If Comey had kept his yap shut, or noted that there was an FBI investigation into Trump, it would’ve balanced things out, and she would have won easily."
14062,I don’t think so but a third party might. I remember unofficial “Republicans for Obama” shirts back in 2008.
14063,Should these guys really be taken seriously after how bad they botched super Tuesday?
14064,Happy cake day
14065,Especially when it's paid for with unicorn farts.
14066,*we’re gonna need a bigger tent*
14067,No
14068,"Not big on conspiracies but I gotta tell you all, the Sander’s win in NV, where I live and have worked in casinos my entire life, makes me seriously wonder. The union that was reported as so big and powerful, and the members voted in opposition to what the union was saying they were against-Sanders-is really strange. The Republicans run most of these casinos. They definitely influence their employees. Make no mistake. So the whole Trump wanting to run against Sanders conspiracy, it made sense he’d win here. I know it sounds out there."
14069,"Idk, I have no practical say in what media channels choose to say or present. They should do their best to boycott things they dont like and allow the free market to speak."
14070,Biden being a gun owner may help with some of that cultural connection you talked about.
14071,It's the Jeb! Meme but actually real and also for a much better politician
14072,Come on Texas! Don’t let me down!
14073,"Bernie has taken much of the latino vote, which is strong for Hillary, but Biden has taken much of the white working class vote away from Bernie.  This helped Biden win Oklahoma and Maine from Bernie.

There aren't many latino heavy states left in the primary, just New Mexico and Arizona.  This means that Biden take states like Idaho and North Dakota on Tuesday which Bernie won last time.

The big prize is obviously Michigan due to it having most of the delegates on Tuesday."
14074,I'm a wayofthebern subscriber and I'm continuing to make 6 figures while WFH. Your stereotyping is offensive and self-defeating.
14075,"I agree, hopefully we kick trump out in November then rid the party of his and his cronies stench"
14076,"I've been searching for a candidate to support and have been leaning toward Bernie. I don't like that a lot of ""Bernie Bros"" have been making a bad name for themselves, but who knows if these strangers on the internet who slander other candidates even actually support Bernie? I know it's not something Bernie would endorse. 

What I'm saying is that you shouldn't judge a candidate solely based on the Redditors who purportedly support them. If you look at the numbers, there are a LOT more people in Bernie subreddits than Biden ones, which means there are going to be a lot more people on the fringe of the Bernie camp who resort to insults and other hateful tactics that the majority of us would disavow."
14077,"Gee, it’s almost like being a member of a party and listening to the leaders of said party is important to some people."
14078,"We have Nancy.

Be thankful for Soccer mom's and moderate candidates in 2018."
14079,"True, I temporarily blanked, when writing that post, on her executive experience as the police chief for Orlando. That plus 4 years in congress....the same, or more, than Pete."
14080,Gotta be careful and strategic with Senators for those pics. Need some allies in that Chamber and opening up a seat that could be flipped via Governor appointment or by special election hurts chances of Dem majority
14081,Obama was way left of Biden when he was elected. How will Biden be more progressive?  How has he changed since then?
14082,"You should be proud of the campaign you supported, and of yourself for giving a shit about making life better for Americans. Bernie has done a hell of a job in the last 4 years getting America to talk seriously about progressive politics. Making positive change is a slow process in America, but it’s always worth it."
14083,"God I hope not.

I jokingly call my granddad a Bernie bro, because he voted for him in 2016 and will vote for him 2020. My granddad's 93-years-old and super sweet, and he's ultra-liberal so Bernie is the one who matches him best on policies. 

It does amuse me to call granddad a Bernie Bro though. It makes him laugh."
14084,And only partly worked.
14085,"If it happens, it's unfortunate. The only gun to my head that will get me to support Bernie is him directly against Trump, and it took me a lot of soul searching to even get that far. If Bernie and his supporters want to take their ball and go home, they can go ahead, and I wouldn't be surprised if they did. For a supporter base that says it is the working class though, there is a tremendous amount of privilege implied by that decision. To turn your back on the good that can be done, because it isn't done your way is despicable. Especially when it is guaranteed to cause suffering to the people who don't have the privilege of waiting 4 more years for things to get better.

Make no mistake, this narrative that the Democratic party is anti-progressive is flat out false. I think if Warren were actually viable right now, you'd have seen Pete endorsing her instead. Bernie's politics of ""If you're not with me, you're corrupt and part of the establishment"", is what has brought out the ""establishment"" against him. To be clear, the ""establishment"" are the people who still have to get through elections down ticket. The ""establishment"" are the people he needs to have any chance at all of passing anything, and he shits on them every day, 3-4 times a day."
14086,"The majority of Biden's policies are on his website.   You can find the biggest hits linked on the side bar.  

Beyond that some of his stump speeches are about policy and can be found on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/joebiden)."
14087,"https://gfycat.com/scarcemadeupimago/

Yup!"
14088,Do you have a link to the worker’s response? That got me interested
14089,"It REALLY depends on his questions, tone, and rebuttal.   
  
This COULD be Bernie lobbing Biden some soft balls so that Biden can hit it out of the park in front of Bernie's audience."
14090,"I have little doubt that Bloomberg drops tomorrow and starts giving Joe air cover.

Anyways, we might have a shot of getting Joe a majority of the delegates and we shouldnt squander it, we dont want Sanders supporters whining all the way to november do we?

You are welcome here."
14091,VA Secretary would be a great spot for him.
14092,"I know some 30 year olds with less stamina.

And by some I mean literally every 30+ year old person I know."
14093,Yo I remember when this sub had 28 people.
14094,Biden hiding in plain View
14095,Dumb move by trump as MI and PA are swing states which is gonna be crucial for him winning the election. They won't forget this
14096,Thank you and your family so much
14097,MA has special elections instead of appointments.
14098,okay
14099,"Thanks for bringing this to light, but this clip leaves out the few ""sentences"" before this sentence, which make this also maliciously edited. It seems like this shows we can never really trust these soundbites no matter whose ""side"" it's coming from."
14100,"&gt;Is there a chance Bloomberg gets vp

No"
14101,"I'd love her on the ticket, but only provided that her Senate seat wouldn't fall into GOP hands any time soon."
14102,"There are people much more qualified for Secretary of State than Pete. I don't think he has any noteworthy foreign policy experience. Maybe a different cabinet spot, but not that one."
14103,"""We're going to build a Blue Wall from Pennsylvania to Iowa and Donald Trump is going to pay for it.""

Team Joe lets get it done!"
14104,"Will a bloomberg endorsement not hurt joes black base? 

I think it would be best to drop out and endorse bernie. Having a billionaire backing you will tarnish his ""purity"" and completely mess up everything lol itd be funny to watch."
14105,I would like to see a Malarkey Meter like Politifact
14106,that is a huge concern but Trump won because HRC had unearned baggage and Trump made massive promises.
